 Updated 4/3/2017The Agency was required to contract with an independent consultant to develop a plan to convert Medicaid payments for outpatient services from a cost based reimbursement methodology to a prospective payment system. The study is required to identify steps necessary for the transition to be completed in a budget neutral manner.  As required by Specific Appropriation 181 of the 2015 General Appropriations Act, the report was submitted to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on November 30, 2015.
