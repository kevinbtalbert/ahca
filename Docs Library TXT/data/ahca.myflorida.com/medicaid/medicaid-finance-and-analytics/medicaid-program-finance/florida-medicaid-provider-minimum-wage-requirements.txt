Florida Medicaid Provider Minimum Wage Requirements
On June 2, 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis signed the Freedom  First budget for State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2022-2023. The Freedom First Budget  provided over $600 million in funding to the Agency for Health Care  Administration (Agency or AHCA)  for the sole purpose of increasing the minimum wage for employees of Medicaid  providers to at least $15.00 an hour.
Requirements

The Agency shall enter into a supplemental wage agreement  with each provider to include this minimum wage requirement to ensure  compliance. The agreement must require the provider to agree to pay each of its  employees at least $15.00 per hour. The agreement shall include an attestation  under penalty of perjury under section 837.012, Florida Statutes, stating that  every employee of the provider, as of October 1, 2022, will be paid at least  $15.00 per hour.
Beginning January 1, 2023, an employee of a provider  receiving an increased rate that is not receiving a wage of at least $15.00 per  hour may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against his  or her provider and, upon prevailing, shall recover the full amount of any back  wages unlawfully withheld plus the same amount as liquidated damages, and shall  be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. In addition, they shall be  entitled to such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the  violation including, without limitation, reinstatement in employment and/or  injunctive relief. Such actions may be brought as a class action pursuant to  Rule 1.220 of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.
The Agency shall enter into a supplemental wage agreement  with all managed care plans to ensure these funds are used to raise the wages  of direct care employees under contract with the managed care plan. The managed  care plan shall provide attestation to the Agency that they have amended each  provider’s contract reimbursement rate to comply with this provision by January  1, 2023.
