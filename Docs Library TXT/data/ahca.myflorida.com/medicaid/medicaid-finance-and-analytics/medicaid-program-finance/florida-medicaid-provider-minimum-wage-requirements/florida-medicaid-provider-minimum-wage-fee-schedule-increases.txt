Florida Medicaid Provider Minimum Wage Fee Schedule Increases











Medicaid Minimum Wage HomeSubmit a QuestionFrequently Asked QuestionsSupplemental Wage AgreementFlorida Medicaid Provider Minimum Wage Fee Schedule IncreasesThe 2022 General Appropriations Act provided the Agency with funding to supplement provider rates and fee schedules for the sole purpose of increasing wages of direct care employees of Medicaid Providers to at least $15 per hour. This appropriation is a targeted increase and not an overall increase for all providers, nor does it provide additional reimbursement to pay for staff already receiving $15 per hour.The Agency’s Actuarial Services vendor, Milliman, at the direction of the Agency, provided the estimated impact that a $15 per hour minimum wage for direct care employees would have on costs for healthcare providers. This study was the source the legislature utilized for the appropriation.The Milliman analysis provided the Agency with an estimated percent impact of an increased minimum wage for direct care employees broken down by NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes. The Agency then created a crosswalk that mapped the corresponding NAICS code and percent increase to provider fee schedule and appropriation category.The Florida Legislature appropriated specific amounts for Medicaid services:$5,958,207 was appropriated to increase wages for fee-for-service hospital services$13,832,192 was appropriated to increase wages for fee-for-service nursing home services$34,991,119 was appropriated to increase wages for fee-for-service ICF/IID services$30,218,138 was appropriated to increase wages for all other fee-for-service categories (fee schedules)The remaining appropriation is for the Prepaid Health plans to pass through to providers the $15 minimum wage increase for services provided under the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program.  Health plans will increase payments to providers by the same increment as was applied in the updated fee schedules for those providers whose reimbursement by health plans is equal to the fee-for-service reimbursement.For services under the Long-Term Care (LTC) Program that are not listed on a fee schedule, the Prepaid Health plans are responsible to increase reimbursement for these services to account for the $15 minimum wage increase.Appropriation CategoryAppropriationAnnualized AppropriationTotal Appropriation203: Hospital Inpatient Services$4,940,128$-$4,940,128207: Hospital Outpatient Services$1,018,079$-$1,018,079208: Other Fee-for-Service Hospice$840,002$279,986$1,119,988209: Personal Care Services$14,670,065$-$14,670,065210: Physician and Health Care Practitioner Services$14,083,964$-$14,083,964211: Prepaid Health Plans$67,678,874$22,559,625$90,238,499217: Assistive Care Services$344,121$-$344,121220: Intermediate Care Facilities/Developmentally Disabled Community$34,991,119$-$34,991,119222: Prepaid Health Plan/Long Term Care$135,900,000$45,300,000$181,200,000221: Nursing Home Care$10,374,277$3,457,915$13,832,192222: Prepaid Health Plan/Long Term Care - Nursing Home Care$201,566,143$67,185,264$268,751,407Total Appropriation for Minimum Wage Increase$486,406,772$138,782,790$625,189,562 Fee Schedule IncreasesThe Medicaid Fee-for-Service (FFS) Fee Schedules listed below have received an increase for the sole purpose of raising wages of direct care employees of Medicaid providers, including 1099 employees, who provide services under the Florida Medicaid Program to at least $15.00 per hour.
