Florida Nursing Home Prospective Payment Working Group












Florida Nursing Home Prospective Payment Working Group
The 2017 Legislature required the Agency to  convene a working group to review relevant issues and make recommendations specific  to the transition to a prospective payment system for nursing home  reimbursement under the Florida Medicaid program. The group shall consist of  representatives of nursing home providers and other interested stakeholders.  The working group’s focus shall include, but not be limited to: any adjustments  needed to existing targets and ceilings applicable to rate calculations; any  adjustments needed to existing direct care and indirect care subcomponents;  development and refinement of quality measures to be used; the frequency of  rebasing under prospective payments; any exemptions from prospective payments;  considerations for supplemental payments as part of prospective payments; and a  phase-in timeline, if needed, including the need for any transition payments  during phase-in. The working group shall submit a report and any  recommendations to the agency, the Governor, the President of the Senate, and  the Speaker of the House of Representatives by December 1, 2017.
