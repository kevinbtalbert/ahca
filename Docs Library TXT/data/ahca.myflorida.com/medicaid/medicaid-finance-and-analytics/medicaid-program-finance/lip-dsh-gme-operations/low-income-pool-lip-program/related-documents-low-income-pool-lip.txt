Re: Florida's Medicaid Reform Section 1115 Demonstration: Special Term and Condition (STC) #105.2(b)Status of DY 10 and DY 11 Low Income Pool Distribution Model DevelopmentThe distribution model for Demonstration Year 10 (DY 10) can be found in GAA, and the legislature will have final say in next yearâs (DY 11) distribution method based on final Standard Terms and Conditions. Â The documents below are related to drafts of the Special Terms and Conditions that are still being negotiated. CMS established the funding amounts and parameters for the pool and, AHCA, with extensive input from the legislative staff and stakeholders, including the Florida Hospital Association, the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida and HCA, continues to negotiate the final details. Funding for the current fiscal year has been secured, and we continue to work with stakeholders and CMS on a final deal.
