Florida Long-Term Care Partnership Program: A Public-Private Partnership for Long-Term Care Insurance Coverage











Florida Long-Term Care Partnership Program: A Public-Private Partnership for Long-Term Care Insurance CoverageFlorida’s Long-term Care Partnership Program is a partnership program between Medicaid and private long-term care insurers designed to encourage individuals to purchase private long-term care insurance.  Long-Term Care Partnership policies are tax qualified (a portion of premiums paid may be claimed as a tax deduction) under federal law; provide policyholders with inflation protection; and most importantly, provide dollar-for-dollar asset protection in the event the policyholder needs to apply for long-term care Medicaid assistance.   For every dollar that a partnership policy pays out in benefits, a dollar of assets can be protected from Medicaid spend-down requirements.LegislationThe authorizing language for the establishment of the Florida Long-Term Care Partnership (LTCP) Program by the Agency for Health Care Administration, in consultation with the Office of Insurance Regulation and the Department of Children and Family Services, is located in s. 409.9102, Florida Statutes, and Rule Chapter 69O-157.201 of the Florida Administrative Code.This language may be accessed using the links below.Florida StatutesChapter 409.9102 Qualified state Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership Program in FloridaChapter 627.94075, Florida Statutes, A qualified state Long-Term Care Insurance Partnership Program in FloridaChapter 627.94076 Time limit on certain defensesChapter 627.9403 Scope, Insurance Rates and ContractsChapter 627.9407 Disclosure, advertising, and performance standards for long-term care insuranceChapter 641.2018 Limited coverage for home health care authorizedFlorida Administrative CodeChapter 69O-157.201 Standards For Approved Long-Term Care Partnership Program PoliciesChapter 69O-157.1155 Producer TrainingChapter 65A-1.712 SSI-Related Medicaid Resource Eligibility CriteriaFlorida Medicaid State Plan Amendment
