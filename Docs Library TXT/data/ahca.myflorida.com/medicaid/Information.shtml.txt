.Florida’s Medicaid Redetermination PlanSince the beginning of the Public Health Emergency (PHE), as a requirement to receive additional funding from the federal government, Florida has provided continuous Medicaid coverage and has not disenrolled ineligible recipients. As a result of this policy, Florida saw a significant increase in the number of individuals and families seeking Medicaid assistance, from 3.8 million enrolled in March 2020 to 5.5 million in November 2022. Medicaid eligibility in Florida is determined either by the Department of Children and Families (DCF) or the Social Security Administration (for SSI recipients) while the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) administers the Medicaid Program.As a result of legislative changes in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the continuous coverage provision will end on March 31, 2023, and is untied from the end of the PHE. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) allows state agencies up to 12 months to complete Medicaid reviews once the continuous coverage period ends. Over the next 12 months, the Department will work to notify and communicate to all current Medicaid recipients their redetermination timeframes and next steps.Medicaid Recipient Next StepsBe on the lookout for notices from the Department so you will know when you need to take action regarding your coverage. Be sure to update your contact information through your MyAccess account.If you are still eligible and we can renew your coverage without you doing anything, we will. If this is the case, you will receive an approval letter when your Medicaid coverage has been renewed.If we are not able to renew your coverage automatically, we will send you a notice to reapply, and you will need to take action and complete a redetermination. If you do not respond, you may lose your Medicaid coverage.If you are no longer eligible for Medicaid, there are other options!
