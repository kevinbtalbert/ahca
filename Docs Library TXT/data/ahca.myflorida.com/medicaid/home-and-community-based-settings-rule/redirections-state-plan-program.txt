Home and Community-Based Settings Rule



Redirections State Plan Program












Redirections  State Plan Program
HCB Settings Final  Rule 
 Background  
In January 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS) issued a rule regarding home and community-based (HCB) settings. The rule  requires states to solicit meaningful input from the public on the draft  transition plan which outlines how Florida plans to comply with the new federal  requirements. These new requirements ensure persons who receive Medicaid home  and community-based services do so from providers who:

Help them to be active in the community;
Provide a home-like environment if a person lives in a group  home, assisted living facility or adult family care home; and
Enable them to make personal choices.

Redirections  Transition Plan
The draft transition plan for the Redirections State Plan  Program is designed to ensure individuals receiving home and community based  services authorized under the Redirections program are integrated in, and have  access to, supports in the community including:

Opportunities to seek employment;
Work in competitive integrated settings;
Engage in community life;
Control personal resources; and, 
Maintain the rights of privacy, dignity, respect and freedom.

The draft transition plan describes how the state will assess,  determine compliance, remediate and monitor the program’s continued compliance  with the HCB settings requirements.
