FX VisionTransforming Florida's Medicaid Enterprise to provide the best value, highest quality health care to Floridians.FX Guiding Principles





Enable high-quality and accessible dataUse evidence-based decision-makingImprove health care outcomesImprove provider and recipient experiences








Reduce complexityEnable good stewardship of Medicaid fundsImprove integration with partnersEnable holistic decision-making rather than short-term focus





 Technology Trends 



Health CareThe value-based care model is becoming more common, which requires tracking health care outcomes rather than services deliveredInteractions with managed care plans are changing the traditional roles and responsibilities








TechnologyInformation Technology (IT) vendors are becoming more specialized in what they doData sets and data needs are increasing in complexityCompatibility between different systems is of increasing importance








Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)CMS issued a rule in 2016 requiring states to follow a modular approach to Medicaid IT acquisition, which reduces system risk compared to a single vendor systemModularity means States can take advantage of vendor specialization in niche offerings and that the latest technology and processes can be implemented more quickly and cost effectively
