Third Party Liability (TPL)











Third Party Liability (TPL)The Third Party Liability Unit is responsible for identifying, managing and recovering funds for claims paid for by Florida Medicaid for which a third party was liable, thereby ensuring Medicaid is the payer of last resort. TPL recovery services are contracted with Health Management Systems (HMS), Inc. Some examples of liable third parties include: Medicare and other insurance companies, tort/casualty settlements, recipient estates, and trust and annuity recovery. New or updated third party insurance information is also added to the Florida Medicaid Management Information System (FMMIS) in order to cost avoid claims that are submitted by Medicaid providers. When a provider submits a claim and a recipient has other insurance, the provider is instructed to bill the other insurance company prior to billing Medicaid. In addition, the TPL Unit also works in conjunction with the Agency's Bureau of Medicaid Program Integrity to conduct other Medicaid recoupment projects such as: overpayments, duplicate payments, provider audits, and overutilization.Notices to Florida Medicaid regarding any third-party benefit, including trust, annuity, or estate probate actions, must be submitted in accordance with sections 409.910, 409.9101, and 733.2121, Florida Statutes (F.S.), to the appropriate address located below.Florida Medicaid TPL Recovery ProgramP.O.
