.The core instruments must be included with assessments and reassessments prior authorized on or after October 9, 2023.PDF versions of the core instruments score sheets must be included when seeking prior authorization of treatment plans for intervention services.Behavior analysis services provided with other servicesThe Agency recognizes there are situations when the delivery of medically necessary behavior analysis services is required to complete the delivery of other medically necessary services such as speech or physical therapy. In these situations, the behavior analysis services are reimbursable by Florida Medicaid when the co-occurring condition(s) requiring the other medically necessary services is(are) documented in the individual’s behavior assessment and behavior plan, and the behavior analysis services are medically necessary, indicated in the treatment plan, and prior authorized.Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)The Agency directed eQHealth Solutions, Inc. to implement a multidisciplinary team approach to reviewing prior authorization requests for behavior analysis services in Regions 4 and 7, as a pilot, beginning July 1, 2019. As a part of the MDT review process, all requests for more than 20 hours per week must undergo telephone or face-to-face staffing to ensure the child is receiving all necessary services and supports. While this approach has proven valuable in obtaining additional information about the needs of the child, the Agency has identified opportunities to streamline and expedite the process, while continuing to engage providers and parents.The Agency has limited the circumstances in which an MDT meeting is needed, as follows:If the request for BA services can be approved after completion of the desk review, the provider will be notified electronically via eQSuites, and the care coordinator will contact the parent/legal guardian to notify of the final decision.If the request for BA services cannot be approved because information is missing, there are inconsistencies in the record, or the request does not meet medical necessity (in whole or part), eQHealth will schedule a peer- to-peer telephonic review with the provider in lieu of an MDT meeting. If the concerns can be resolved during the peer-to-peer review, the case will be approved.If the request still cannot be approved after the peer-to-peer review, eQHealth will call the parent to discuss the decision and follow with the standard denial letter with appeal rights.If eQHealth believes the child may benefit from additional services or supports, a care coordinator will contact the parent to discuss how to initiate those services. BA services will not be delayed while this is occurring.eQHealth will only initiate MDT meetings in cases where convening treatment providers may be of benefit in maximizing the treatment outcomes, particularly where progress has stalled or regressed over several review periods.It is of chief importance to us to solicit input from parents prior to making a service authorization decision, so eQHealth will continue to contact the child’s parent/guardian prior to completing the review to collect information and to discuss any additional needs that may have arisen.For more information, please visit the eQHealth Training Resources page.   Recipient Information1.

eQHealth’s WebsiteBehavior Analysis eQSuite User GuideBehavior Plan Provider TrainingSubmitting a Modification to a BA Prior Authorization TrainingComprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation RequirementsTo initiate behavior analysis services, the Agency requires that the provider submit a copy of the child’s Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation (CDE), along with all other required documentation to eQHealth Solutions, Inc.The Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation (CDE) is the national practice standard necessary to diagnose autism as well as other developmental or behavioral disorders and indicate the most appropriate treatment(s) to address the child’s needs. A CDE is a thorough review and assessment of the child’s development and behavior. A CDE may be performed by a multidisciplinary team or individual practitioner. In either case, the CDE must be led by a licensed practitioner working within their scope of practice. The CDE must use evidence-based practice standards, methods and instruments, and the report must include assessment findings and treatment recommendations appropriate to the recipient.  For example, CDE testing may include:Parent or guardian interviewTeacher assessmentDiagnostic testing using tools such as:Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)The Childhood Autism Rating Scale – 2nd edition (CARS2)Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R)Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS)Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R)Social Communication QuestionnaireBattelle Developmental Inventory– 2nd editionHearing and vision testingGenetic testingNeurological and/or other medical testingAlternative Assessments in Pilot RegionsIn the MDT regions, BA services may be initiated for a child during an excessive wait time for their scheduled CDE. When a child is on a waiting list for a scheduled CDE, eQHealth may accept the following documentation, in lieu of the CDE:Scheduled CDE confirmationChildren 0 – 36 months of age: Early Intervention Services evaluation/Individual and Family Support PlanChildren older than 36 months of age:Individual Education Assessment (IEP) or school district assessment for IEPNeurological evaluationHistory and physical from a licensed physician documenting behaviors and evaluation conducted to ascertain diagnosisAuthorizations without a CDE are temporary. These alternative assessments do not replace the requirements for a CDE. If parents are having difficulty finding a provider to perform the CDE, their child’s health plan is available to help. Parents can also contact the Agency at 877-254-1055 and we will work with them or their child’s plan to find a provider.
