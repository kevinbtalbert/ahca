Florida KidCare - Title XXI – Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)















Florida KidCare - Title XXI – Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)Florida KidCare is the state’s children’s health insurance program for uninsured children who meet income and eligibility requirements.  The 1998 Legislature created Florida KidCare in response to the passage of Title XXI of the Social Security Act in 1997.  Florida KidCare provides health insurance to children in families with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Three state agencies and the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, a non-profit organization, form the Florida KidCare partnership.  MediKids, Florida Healthy Kids and Title XXI Children’s Medical Services Managed Care Plan compose the Title XXI Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  CHIP is not an entitlement program and the families pay a monthly family premium of $15 or $20 depending on the family’s income.  Florida KidCare also includes Medicaid for children. Visit www.floridakidcare.org or call 1-888-540-5437.The table below describes the four Florida KidCare components.FLORIDA KIDCARE Medicaid Title XIXChildren’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Title XXIComponentsMedicaid for ChildrenMediKidsHealthy KidsChildren’s Medical Services Managed Care PlanPartner Agency ResponsibilityDepartment of Children and FamiliesDetermines eligibility for Medicaid.Agency for Health Care AdministrationAdministers the MediKids program.Florida Healthy Kids CorporationDetermines eligibility for CHIP and administers the Healthy Kids program.Department of HealthAdministers the Children’s Medical Services Managed Care Plan.Age group0 through 181 through 45 through 181 through 18 for children with special health care needsPremiumsNone$15/family/month – family income 134% to 158% of the federal poverty level$20/family/month – family income over 158% to 200% of the federal poverty levelCopaymentsNoneNone$5 or $10most servicesNoneFull Pay ProgramNone$248.21/child/monthSee the Healthy Kids’ website for premium information.NoneEligibility DeterminationDepartment of Children and Families or the Social Security AdministrationFlorida Healthy Kids CorporationFlorida Healthy Kids CorporationFlorida Healthy Kids CorporationFlorida KidCare ResourcesProgram EvaluationThe annual Florida KidCare Program Evaluation is prepared by the Institute for Child Health Policy, University of Florida, under contract to the Agency for Health Care Administration.
