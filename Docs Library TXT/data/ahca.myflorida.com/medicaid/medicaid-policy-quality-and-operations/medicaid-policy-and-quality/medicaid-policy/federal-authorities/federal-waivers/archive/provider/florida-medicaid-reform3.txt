Reform RatesThe Final Reform Rates for Broward (Area 10), and Duval, Baker, Clay and Nassau (Area 4) counties have been certified by the Agency's actuary and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. As rates are calculated by Area, the Area 4 rates cover all counties in Area 4, and therefore the counties of Duval, Baker, Clay, and Nassau have the same rates."

Florida Medicaid Reform Data BookThis document provides historic fee-for-service data for all four Medicaid Reform target populations: TANF; SSI; HIV/AIDS and Children with Chronic Conditions. Summary statistics are provided for all four populations. In addition, claims and service distribution tables are provided for each population except Children with Chronic Conditions.Prospective plans will find this information essential in the development of their proposed benefit package(s). This Medicaid Reform Data Book is available in CD format, upon request. Please submit your request to John Churchill at John.Churchill@_blank.myflorida.com. Please include your name, organization name, address, phone number and the number of CD you are requesting. There is a limit of 2 CDs per organization.Florida Medicaid Reform: Medicaid Rx ModelFlorida’s version of the Medicaid Rx risk-adjustment model is now available. This model will be used during the initial stages of Medicaid Reform to risk adjust capitation rates paid to health care plans participating in Reform areas. The Medicaid Rx model was created by a team from the University of California San Diego to use historical pharmacy utilization data as a predictor of future health care costs. By combining this model with a health plan’s historical pharmacy utilization, Florida and the health plan can determine its members’ predicted future physical, mental, and pharmacy health care costs with a greater degree of accuracy than with the current age- and gender-based methodology. To run the Medicaid Rx model, you will need a PC or mainframe computer with a copy of SAS and sufficient disk capacity to store your working files and results.

Florida Medicaid Reform Plan Evaluation ToolProspective Health Plan Applicants are required to submit customized benefits packages with their Health Plan Applications. These benefits packages will be tested for actuarial equivalency and benefit sufficiency. To assist health plans in designing customized benefit packages that will satisfy these tests, AHCA has provided the Florida Medicaid Reform Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) for health plans to test proposed benefit packages before submitting them to AHCA for approval.Since the initial release of the PET, the 2006 Legislature (Conference Report on House Bill 5001, the 2006-2007 General Appropriations Act) has restored adult vision and adult hearing services to the standard Medicaid benefit. In addition, adult partial denture services have been added. The PET has been revised to include these restored and added services. On May 26, 2006, the revised PET was made available to the prospective health plans.Prospective plans are required to submit their updated benefits packages for the September 1, 2006 through August 31, 2007 time period to the Agency no later than June 5, 2006 for inclusion in July 2006 Choice Counseling materials. Benefits packages received after June 5, 2006 may be incorporated in subsequent versions of Choice Counseling materials.The PET and user instructions for Year One are no longer available for testing benefits packages.Plans may submit the updated benefits packages in Microsoft format via email to John Churchill at John.Churchill@_blank.myflorida.com.Medicaid Reform Health Plan Application Frequently Asked QuestionsSince release of the application, the Agency has worked with prospective health plan applicants to provide clarification regarding the application and contracting process.
