Florida Medicaid Reform

Approved  1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver Application

CMS approved AHCA’s proposal to waive certain federal statutory provisions and move forward in reforming Medicaid as authorized by Senate Bill 838. The draft 1115 waiver application was posted on Agency's website on August 31, 2005. AHCA submitted the waiver application on October 3, 2005, after posting the draft application for 30 days as required by Senate Bill 838. CMS reviewed the application and after intensive negotiations with Florida, granted approval.
The Approved 1115 Waiver Application updated October 19, 2005, contains modifications to include the required  CMS changes, revisions based on comments from the public,  technical edits, and repagination. The technical changes can be found on pages 8, 10, 12, 15, 28, 36, 42, 48, 49, 91, 92, 93, and 94. The non-technical changes can be found on pages 17, 37, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, and 65.
