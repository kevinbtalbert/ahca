Presumptively Institutional Settings












Presumptively Institutional Settings
Home and community-based service providers  identified as presumptively institutional under “Presumptively Institutional” Section  A or Section B of the Assessment Tools or that were unable to remediate deficiencies  identified under “Presumptively Institutional” Section C or the HCBS  Characteristics section of the Assessment Tools may submit an evidentiary  package for heightened scrutiny.  Once the managed care plan has reviewed the  evidentiary package and confirms all necessary information has been included,  the evidentiary package must be uploaded to the Agency’s FTP Site at the file  path Submissions > Quality Submissions > HCB Setting.  The managed care plan must use the file  naming convention: “ABCYYYYHCB000000000E”, where ABC stands for the managed  care plan’s three-character plan identifier, YYYY stands for the four-digit  year in which the evidentiary package was completed, HCB stands for home and  community-based, 000000000 stands for the nine-digit Florida Medicaid provider  ID number forwarded to the plan by its Agency contract manager for the selected  facility, and E stands for evidentiary package.
