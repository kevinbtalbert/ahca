Florida Medicaid Reform (2005-2011)  Approved 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver Initial 5-Year Application
In 2005, the  Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 838, authorizing the Agency to seek  an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project waiver, pursuant to section  1115 of the Social Security Act (SSA) to create a statewide initiative to  provide a more efficient and effective service delivery system that enhances  quality of care and outcomes in the Florida Medicaid program. To effectively  implement the program, the Agency submitted a draft application to Federal CMS  on August 30, 2005, requesting a section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver  in order to waive statutory provisions under section 1902 of the SSA. The draft  1115 waiver application was posted on Agency's website on August 31, 2005.
  On October 3,  2005, the Agency submitted the official waiver application to Federal CMS after  posting the draft application for 30 days as required by SB 838. Federal CMS  reviewed the application and after intensive negotiations with Florida, granted  approval on October 19, 2005, to waive certain federal statutory provisions and  move forward in reforming Medicaid as authorized by SB 838. To view the  Approved 1115 Waiver Application, as well as the draft waiver application, you  may visit the Approved 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver Application web page.
In December 2005,  the Agency submitted an implementation plan to the Florida Legislature, which  summarized the implementation milestones and activities that had been  undertaken and would be completed before beginning operation of the waiver on  July 1, 2006. To view the Implementation Plan, you may visit the Florida Medicaid Reform Implementation Plan web page. 
Beginning in  January 2006 through June 2008, the Agency held a series of informational  meetings/workshops on Medicaid Reform for providers, beneficiaries, and  advocates in the demonstration counties of Broward, Duval, Baker, Clay, and  Nassau prior to implementation of the waiver on July 1, 2006. To view the  meetings/workshop schedules and handouts, you may visit the Medicaid Reform Meetings/Workshops web page.
