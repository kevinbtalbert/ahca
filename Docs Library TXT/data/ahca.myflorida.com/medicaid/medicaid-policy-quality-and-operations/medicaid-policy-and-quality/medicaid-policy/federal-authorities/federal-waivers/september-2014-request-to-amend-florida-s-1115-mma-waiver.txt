September 2014 - Request to Amend Florida’s 1115 MMA Waiver











Federal AuthoritiesManaged Medical AssistanceSeptember 2014 - Request to Amend Florida’s 1115 MMA Waiver (Project Number 11-W-002064) and Public InputThe State is seeking federal authority to amend Florida’s 1115 MMA Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Waiver (Project Number 11-W-002064) to allow certain populations who were previously excluded from the MMA program to voluntarily enroll. The proposed amendment will allow Medicaid-eligible recipients residing in group home facilities licensed under Section (s.) 393.067, Florida Statutes (F.S.), as well as Medicaid-eligible children receiving Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) services to voluntarily enroll in Florida’s MMA program, a component of the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) program.  This amendment is being submitted to implement Florida law  that was amended during the 2014 Legislative session (HB 5201), that allows recipients residing in a group home facility and children receiving PPEC services to voluntarily enroll in Florida’s MMA program upon federal approval. Waiver History (2006-2014)The following is an historical description of the federal and state authority granted since authorization of the waiver (Project Number 11-W-00206/4) was obtained in 2005.Initial 5-Year Period (2006-2011):  On October 19, 2005, Florida's 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver named “Medicaid Reform” was approved by Federal CMS. The program was implemented in Broward and Duval Counties July 1, 2006 and expanded to Baker, Clay and Nassau Counties July 1, 2007.  The program was terminated August 1, 2014 with the implementation of the MMA program.  The state authority to operate this program is located in s. 409.91211, F.S., and sunsets October 1, 2014.Three-Year Extension Period (2011-2014):  On December 15, 2011, the State received Federal CMS approval to extend the waiver to maintain and continue operations of Medicaid Reform for the period July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014. MMA Waiver Amendment (2014):   On June 14, 2013, the State received Federal CMS approval to amend the waiver to terminate the Medicaid Reform program and implement the MMA program as approved by Federal CMS.  The name of the waiver was changed to Florida’s MMA program. Three-Year Waiver Extension (2014-2017):  During the 2011 Florida Legislative session, the Florida Legislature passed and Governor Scott signed legislation to expand managed care in the Florida Medicaid program with the creation of the MMA program.  Part IV of Chapter 409, F.S., directed the Agency to submit any federal waiver or state plan amendment requests to Federal CMS as necessary to implement the MMA program no later than October 1, 2014.  In accordance with this directive, the Agency sought and received approval to extend the waiver authorization period from July 31, 2014 until June 30, 2017.To view the July 31, 2014, approved Special Terms and Conditions of the waiver, Waiver Authorities document, Expenditure Authorities document and  the Approval Letter, please click on the following links:
