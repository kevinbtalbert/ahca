Federal and State Correspondence after Extension Request Submission On August 17, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) advised the Agency that they would review and process the State’s request to renew the Reform Demonstration under section 1115(a) authority, rather than under section 1115(e) authority as originally requested by the State.

Q: Does this mean that federal CMS has denied the state’s request for extension of the Medicaid Reform Waiver?A: No, the request has not been denied.  CMS has simply notified the state that they will process the request under the section 1115(a) authority.  This authority would allow CMS to request changes/ amendments to the terms and conditions of the waiver.  Please note the last sentence of the letter from CMS which states “We look forward to working with the State in the coming months toward renewing the Florida Medicaid Reform Demonstration.”Q: Does this mean that action on the extension/ renewal of the Medicaid Reform Waiver will be delayed?A: Under 1115(a), there is no prescribed timeframe by which CMS must process a waiver request. At this point, the state does not anticipate that a review under the (a) authority would impact waiver operations and the original waiver does not expire until June 30, 2011.  While there is no formal processing timeframe, the State will work with CMS to facilitate timely review.On December 16, 2010, the Agency received a letter from CMS requesting additional information on Florida’s 1115 waiver extension request.  Please click on the link below to view this letter.
