Back to HCBS Spending PlanFlorida HCBS Frequently Asked QuestionsQuestion 1: I received funding for the original retention/stipend HCBS enhanced funding opportunity. Can I use these funds to cover overtime compensation? NEWYes, overtime compensation is an allowable expense under the staffing flexibility category associated with the stipend funding only. This would be considered an “OTHER” item within the staffing flexibility category.Question 2: I would like to revise my expenditures on my Q1 report. Is there a process in place to revise a prior quarterly report? Yes, during the submission of your Q2 report, you will have the ability to revise or report new expenditures from your first quarter report. Information regarding the second quarter report will be released in October.Question 3: I applied for the HCBS enhanced funding opportunity that closed in February. I was accepted and have since been sent funding, however, I only have 1099 workers. Can I still use this funding if I am using the funding for other approved categories and not directly paying my 1099 workers a bonus? No, this is not allowable. The application for HCBS enhanced funding for one-time payments to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff that opened on December 17, 2021, and closed on February 14, 2022, does not allow for payments to contracted or temporary staff (1099 workers). You must return this funding to the Agency immediately if you only have 1099 workers. For more information on how to return the funds, please contact FLHCBS@mslc.com. The original retention and stipend opportunity is only to be used on W2 employees who are direct care workers. All other W2 employees are not eligible for funding.Question 4: I received an approval letter for the 1099 supplemental funding opportunity, what can I use this funding for? For the purpose of the 1099 supplemental funding opportunity, there are only two allowable funding uses – a hiring/signing bonus to recruit new 1099 workers and a retention bonus for current 1099 workers. No other costs are allowable for this supplemental opportunity.Question 5: What is a 1099 worker?A 1099 worker is an individual for whom you file a 1099 MISC form with the IRS.Question 6: I received my funding after June 30th and would like to re-budget items on my final spend plan.You can report the revised spending plans along with your spending in the following the end of the second quarter on September 30, 2022. It is recommended that for any revisions to the spend plan, you review the guidelines and limitations set in the final approval letter sent from AHCA for your new categories.Question 7: I am a sole provider with no employees; am I eligible for ARPA funding?For providers without an employee, funds accepted by said providers for the One-Time Provider Stipend: Staffing Capacity and Staffing Stability, and the One-Time Provider Retention, activities, may not be paid to an owner-employee. Funds accepted for these activities must be used to recruit or retain at least one additional employee.Question 8: I did not receive my ARPA funds prior to June 30th, 2022, do I need to complete the Quarterly Reporting for April 1, 2022 – June 30th, 2022?No, you will not be responsible for submitting any Quarterly Reporting for April 1, 2022 – June 30th, 2022 if you did not receive any funding prior to June 30th. Information will be forthcoming regarding future reporting due dates.Question 9: When is the ARPA Quarterly Reporting due?In your original acceptance letter packet, the due date of the first quarter report for April 1, 2022 – June 30, 2022 was listed as July 30th, 2022. The due date for your first submission has been changed. The portal will now open on Monday, August 15th, 2022 and close on Monday, August 22nd, 2022. Information will be forthcoming regarding future reporting due dates.Question 10: How do I complete the ARPA Quarterly Reporting?On Friday, August 12th, 2022, you will receive an email with instructions to the email address included on your final spend plan submission. This email will contain a specific portal link individual to your organization. This unique URL will provide you with access to a portal where you will complete your quarterly reporting. Each provider will be given their own specific URL. You will have one week to submit your quarterly report. A template will be provided prior to the opening of the portal in order for you to prepare the necessary documentation that will be required.Question 11: Can I use the ARPA funds for payroll taxes associated with bonus and retention payments made to employees?Yes, payroll taxes and any increase in workers compensation premiums are allowable costs only if incurred by providers directly as a result of bonus payments to workers.  ARPA funds may not be used to cover payroll costs associated with base salary payments or adjustments.Question 12: When will I receive a payment?Beginning June 9, 2022, the first in a series of payments was made to Florida providers within the iBudget waiver program who applied for HCBS provider funding for one-time provider stipend payments to support HCBS Providers and one-time payments to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff.AHCA anticipates all payments will be made to Florida iBudget providers by July 14, 2022. Payments to eligible providers within the Long-Term Care (LTC) program who applied for HCBS provider funding for one-time provider stipend and one-time retention will begin processing shortly.Question 13: How long will I have to spend the money?The State of Florida has set June 30, 2023 as the date by which providers must spend accepted funds. Florida’s HCBS Funding Opportunity for Provider Stipend and Retention payments will be a one-time disbursement.Question 14: When will letters be sent to providers who applied for a 1099 Contracted Workers retention payment?Award letters to eligible providers who applied for a one-time retention payment for HCBS Providers utilizing 1099 Contracted Workers through the Agency’s HCBS programs will be coming soon. Eligible providers had until May 20, 2022 to apply for this funding.Question 15: Should I apply for the one-time retention payment to support programs for 1099 workers if I applied for the HCBS enhanced funding that closed in February?The application for HCBS enhanced funding for one-time payments to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff that opened on December 17, 2021, and closed on February 14, 2022, does not allow for payments to contracted or temporary staff (1099 workers).On April 19, 2022, a supplemental application period for HCBS Providers utilizing 1099 contracted workers was opened. If you utilize 1099 contracted workers and applied for the one-time payment to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff you will not be accepted for that program. If you wish to have the opportunity to utilize funding for 1099 workers, you must submit an application for HCBS funding to support programs for 1099 workers by no later than May 20, 2022.More information on the application process and a list of eligible provider types can be found here. The application process for eligible providers is to ensure appropriate measures are put in place to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.Question 16: Should I have received an acceptance letter?The first batch of acceptance letters went out beginning on April 19, 2022. These letters were sent to iBudget providers who had applied for either the one-time payments to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff, the one-time provider stipend payments to support HCBS Providers, or both.Letters are being emailed to the email address listed by the provider on the application submitted and mailed to the address of record associated with the provider’s Medicaid Provider ID.A second batch of letters will go out soon to LTC Managed Care program providers who applied for the one-time payments to aid eligible HCBS providers in recruiting and retaining qualified staff, the one-time provider stipend payments to support HCBS Providers, or both.Question 17: What do I do once I receive an acceptance letter?Once you have received your letter, you must go to the AHCA HCBS Budget Detail and Acceptance Letter Portalto enter your final funding request using the budget detail form.

Per the Section B – Payment Information tab of the One-Time Provider Stipend/ One-Time Provider Retention application, providers may use this funding to enhance, expand, or strengthen Home Community Base Services (HCBS) workforce in the following areas:Staffing Capacity Increase may include one-time retention bonuses such as hero pay that honors caregiver who have courageously cared for Florida’s seniors during the pandemic.Staffing Stability to reduce turnover among staff through hazard pay, sick bank creation, differential pay for nights and weekends, and/or fringe benefits for staff.Staffing Flexibility provides staff assistance with transportation through incentives such as agency-supplied care service either directly or through contracts with ride sharing services like Lyft and Uber or providing passes for public transportation.Improved Professional Development offering new or expanded training opportunities such as paying staff for attending conferences, CEU credits, and college coursework.As described in Section A – Attestation tab of the One-Time Provider Stipend/ One-Time Provider Retention applications, funding is contingent on providers attesting that they will spend the funding only on items included in the spending/staffing plan developed and submitted as a part of their application and approved for awarding of funds. Additionally, per Section A – Attestation tab, providers who apply for One-Time Provider Stipend funding must submit quarterly reports to provide updates on the outcomes of their spending/staffing plan implementation.Question 20: Do I have to spend awarded funding in the time frame and do I have to send it back if not spent?Yes.Question 21: Are there limitations on how I spend the retention payments?Use of the HCBS funds should align with all information included in your approved funding application.The provider retention payment is intended to assist providers in building and sustaining their direct care workforce with recruitment, retention, and educational incentives.

Any uses that fall outside of those categories are prohibited.Below is a bulleted list of examples of prohibited expenses for the provider stipend payments. Note that the below list is not comprehensive, but instead is merely illustrative of prohibited uses of ARPA HCBS funding.On-going payments for utilities, rent, or mortgage as well as any business liabilities.Administrative services which include tasks and duties related to maintaining an office setting, including but not limited to scheduling, record keeping and facilities management.Any of the provisions located in 45 C.F.R. § 75.450(c) including, but not limited to: attempting to influence any federal, state, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure, and establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the expenses of a political party.Legal fees, if costs were incurred relating to a violation of, or failure to comply with, a federal, state or local statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the federal award, by the non-federal entity and the violation, or failure to comply, resulted in a criminal conviction or assigned liability in a civil or administrative proceeding. Also, payments may not cover legal fees incurred by the non-federal entity in connection with the defense of suits brough by its employees or ex-employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988, including the cost of all relief necessary to make such employee whole, where the non-federal entity was found liable or settled.Business expenses that do not clearly demonstrate the enhancement, expansion, or strengthening of the Home Community Base Services (HCBS) workforce.

At this time, we encourage providers to carefully consider ways they can enhance, expand, and strengthen HCBS and request funding at a level that is appropriate to support their proposed spending, staffing, and delayed egress plans.Question 26: When will the Agency begin the application process for the other funding opportunities?The Agency plans to initiate the application process for the other funding opportunities soon.

The provider will need to request and obtain permission from the Agency to amend their spending plans and allocation to each activity.Question 35: Can I use the retention funds to cover costs already incurred prior to the approval, but after the passage of ARPA?No, this is not allowed.Question 36: Who is considered a direct care worker?For purposes of Florida’s One-Time Provider Retention and One-Time Provider Stipend funding opportunities, a Direct Care Worker is defined as in individual that has direct contact with a home and community-based services (HCBS) Medicaid Waiver recipient for purposes of providing an HCBS Waiver covered service (examples include, but are not limited to, personal care, homemaker, and home health services).
