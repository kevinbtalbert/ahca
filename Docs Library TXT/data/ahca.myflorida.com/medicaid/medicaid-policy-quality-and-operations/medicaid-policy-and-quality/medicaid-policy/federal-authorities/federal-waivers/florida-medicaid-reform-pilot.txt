Florida Medicaid Reform Pilot












Florida Medicaid Reform Pilot
Florida's Medicaid Reform was a comprehensive  demonstration that seeked to improve the value of the Medicaid delivery  system.  The program  operated under an  1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver initially approved by the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services (Federal CMS) on October 19, 2005.  State authority to operate the program is  located in Section (s.) 409.91211, Florida Statutes (F.S.), which provides  authorization for a statewide pilot program with implementation that began in  Broward and Duval Counties on July 1, 2006.   The program expanded to Baker, Clay and Nassau Counties on July 1, 2007.  Key components  of the demonstration include:

Comprehensive choice counseling,
Customized benefit packages,
Enhanced benefits for participating in  healthy behaviors,
Risk-adjusted premiums based on  enrollee health status, and
Low Income Pool.

The  Medicaid Reform program was phased out as the MMA  program was implemented in each region of the state no later than October 1,  2014, and as approved by Federal CMS.   The state authority to operate the Medicaid Reform program sunset October 1, 2014.
Waiver History
The  following is an historical description of the waiver since authorization in  2005.
Initial 5-Year Period  (2006-2011): On October  19, 2005, Florida's 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver named "Medicaid  Reform" was approved by Federal CMS to operate the demonstration for the period  from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2010.  The program was implemented in  Broward and Duval Counties July 1, 2006 and expanded to Baker, Clay and Nassau  Counties July 1, 2007.  
Three-Year Extension Period  (2011-2014):  On June 30, 2010, a three-year waiver extension  request was submitted to Federal CMS to maintain and continue operations of  Medicaid Reform for the period July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014.  Federal CMS  granted temporary extensions of the program until December 15, 2011, when final  approval of the waiver extension request was granted for the period December  16, 2011 to June 30, 2014.
MMA Waiver Amendment (June 14, 2013): On June 14, 2013, Federal CMS approved the MMA  amendment that allows for the implementation of a new statewide managed care  delivery system without increasing costs and to continue the Low Income Pool  program. The previously named waiver "Medicaid Reform" was renamed to "Managed  Medical Assistance." Please refer to the Federal  Authorities webpage for the amendment approval  documents. 
MMA  Waiver Extension Request (2014-2017): On November 27, 2013, the Agency submitted  another three-year waiver extension request to Federal CMS to extend Florida's  1115 MMA Waiver for the period July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017.
