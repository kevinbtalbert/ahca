2012 Request for 1115 Waiver / Medically Needy Component











Federal AuthoritiesManaged Medical AssistanceRequest for 1115 Waiver / Medically Needy ComponentDuring the 2011 legislative session, the Legislature considered several alternative approaches to the Medically Needy program.  In the bills (House Bills 7107 and 7109) that were enacted, the Legislature continued the Medically Needy program and directed the Agency to seek federal waiver authority to change the program to provide additional months of coverage, to implement a premium that would not exceed the share of cost and to provide care coordination and utilization management to achieve more cost-effective services.
