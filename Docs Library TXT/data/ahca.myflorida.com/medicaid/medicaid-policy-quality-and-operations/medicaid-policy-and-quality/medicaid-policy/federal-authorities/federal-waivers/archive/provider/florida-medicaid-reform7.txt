Florida Medicaid Reform Data Book 
The Data Book provides historic fee-for-service data and summary statistics for each of the four Medicaid Reform target populations: TANF; SSI; HIV/AIDS and Children with Chronic Conditions.  In addition, claims and service distribution tables are provided for each target population, with the exception of Children with Chronic Conditions.
Prospective plans will find this information essential in the development of their proposed benefit package(s). This Medicaid Reform Data Book is available as a spreadsheet. If you would like to obtain a copy, please submit your request to John Churchill at John.Churchill@ahca.myflorida.com. Be sure to include your name, organization name, address, and phone number. 
Florida Medicaid Reform Plan Evaluation Tool 
The Agency for Health Care Administration has released an updated version of the Plan Evaluation Tool (PET). The PET is currently available as an Excel spreadsheet and has been updated for the 9/1/2007 – 8/31/2008 contract period based on the most current data available.  All Medicaid health plans in Broward and Duval – as well as any new plans in Baker, Clay and Nassau counties – are required to fill out the new PET and submit their new benefit grids, including any requested expanded benefits, to the Agency for the 2007-2008 contract year.  Please be advised that due to the updated data, your approved 2006-2007 benefit grid may no longer pass under the new version of the PET.  To ensure that your grid will be acceptable for the 2007-2008 contract period, please verify your benefits package using the new PET.  The entire Excel spreadsheet with your draft benefits must be submitted to the Agency no later than 5:00 PM on June 11, 2007. You must submit your final benefits to the Agency through the PET no later than 5:00 PM on June 15, 2007.
In order to expedite the review process, please email your plan’s revised draft benefit grid and any supporting documentation for each expanded benefit to John Churchill at John.Churchill@ahca.myflorida.com by 5:00 PM on Monday, June 11, 2007. You must submit your final draft benefit grid and supporting documentation for each expanded benefit to John Churchill by 5:00 p.m. on Friday, June 15, 2007.  Also, please copy Christina Lopez Christina.Lopez@ahca.myflorida.com on each submission. Benefits grids received after June 15, 2007, may cause a delay in your plan’s Medicaid Reform contract execution, as well as a delay in including the benefit details in the Choice Counseling materials.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  If you have any questions or concerns about this process, please do not hesitate to email John Churchill or call him at (850) 410-1858.
For more information on the PET, refer to the corresponding letter for HMO and PSN.
