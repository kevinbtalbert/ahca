Florida’s ARPA HCBS Spending PlanThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) went into effect April 1, 2021.Section 9817 of this Act authorized an increased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) to support Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS).  The ten (10) percentage point enhancement to the FMAP will be based on State Medicaid spending on HCBS services during the period between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022; the Act also stipulates that these funds must be expended by March 31, 2024.The State is required to submit quarterly updates to CMS on the status of the HCBS Spending Plan and Narrative.One-Time Retention Payment for Non-HCBS Waiver ProvidersThe Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) is pleased to announce a disbursement of additional funding from the ARPA HCBS Enhanced Funding Opportunity.
