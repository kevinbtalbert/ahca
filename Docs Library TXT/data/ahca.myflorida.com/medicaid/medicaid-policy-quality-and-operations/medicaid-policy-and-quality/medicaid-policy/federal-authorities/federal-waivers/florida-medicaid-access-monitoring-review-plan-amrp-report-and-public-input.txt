Florida Medicaid Access Monitoring Review Plan (AMRP) Report and Public Input













Florida Medicaid Access Monitoring Review  Plan (AMRP) Report and Public Input

Recently enacted Federal regulations require state Medicaid programs to  develop and publish a medical assistance access monitoring review plan (AMRP)  for the state’s Medicaid recipients.
In  the final clarification for the rule (CMS-2328-FC; Final Access Rule with  Comments), CMS stated that the rule applied only to the state’s fee-for-service  population, and specifically excluded any managed care populations or any  populations covered by a federal waiver program. The first report is due to CMS  by October 1, 2016. This report represents Florida’s submission to meet the  AMRP requirements and establishes a baseline for future monitoring review using  calendar year 2015 data.
 Public  Notice and Public Comment: August 22, 2016 - September 21, 2016  
The  Agency will provide a 30-day public notice and comment period prior to the  submission of the AMRP to Federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS). The Agency will consider all public comments received regarding the  development of the waiver amendment.

The  30-day public notice and public comment period will be held August  22, 2016 through September 22, 2016.  To  view the complete report, please click the following link:
