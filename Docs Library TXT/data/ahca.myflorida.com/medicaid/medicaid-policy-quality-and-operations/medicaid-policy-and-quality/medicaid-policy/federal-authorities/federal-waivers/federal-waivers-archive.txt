Closed Waivers

The following  waivers were closed effective December 31, 2017:


1115 MEDs AD Waiver
        - The program provides assistance for people with disabilities who  are 65 years of age or older, disabled, and who have resources below $5,000 for  an individual and $6,000 for a couple and whose income is less than 88 percent  of the federal poverty level. Those enrolled in the waiver will receive all  Medicaid state plan services.
1915(c)  Project AIDS Care Waiver
1915(c)  Adults with Cystic Fibrosis Waiver
1915(c)  Traumatic Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Waiver


Waiver Amendments

The Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) is  announcing the start of a 30-day public notice and comment period. The Agency  is seeking to amend Florida’s 1115 Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) Waiver and  1915(b)/(c) Long-term Care (LTC) Waiver to:

Transition individuals enrolled in the 1915(c) Adults  with Cystic Fibrosis (ACF) Waiver and the 1915(c) Traumatic Brain and Spinal  Cord Injury (TBI/SCI) Waiver into the 1915(b)/(c) LTC Waiver in order for them  to continue to receive home and community-based services (HCBS). This change  will result in no loss of Medicaid coverage or services for these populations.
Transition individuals enrolled in the 1915(c) Project  AIDS Care (PAC) Waiver who are receiving HCBS and who meet nursing facility  level of care into the 1915(b)/(c) LTC Waiver in order for them to continue to  receive HCBS. This change will result in no loss of Medicaid coverage or  services for the population.
Establish financial and non-financial eligibility  criteria (specified in section 409.904, Florida Statues) in the 1115 MMA Waiver  that will enable individuals who are diagnosed with Acquired Immune Deficiency  Syndrome (AIDS) to obtain and maintain Medicaid coverage without the need for  enrollment in the 1915(c) PAC Waiver. This population does not need HCBS but  are at risk for institutionalization without access to necessary medical/acute  care services (prescribed drugs, physician services, etc.). This change enables  the population to maintain access to needed services and will result in no loss  of Medicaid coverage.
Transition the federal authority to serve individuals  enrolled in the 1115 MEDS-AD Waiver to the 1115 MMA Waiver. This is a technical  change; the population will continue to have access to all Medicaid covered  services. 

The vast majority of these individuals are currently  enrolled in an MMA plan for receipt of their medical, behavioral health,  prescribed drugs, and dental services. The proposed changes will not affect how  they receive these services or the plan in which they are enrolled.
Individuals who are transitioning to the 1915(b)/(c) LTC  Waiver will have an opportunity to choose their LTC plan and will continue to  have access to HCBS that are comparable to the services they are currently  utilizing. In addition, the LTC program offers a more robust benefit package  than the 1915(c) TBI/SCI, ACF, and PAC Waivers, including enhanced case  management standards and expanded benefits. The LTC program also offers  individuals an opportunity to receive care/services through a program with  enhanced quality outcome measures.
The Agency is  also seeking authority from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to  end the 1915(c) TBI/SCI, ACF, and PAC Waivers, and the 1115 MEDS-AD Waiver once  all transitions (described above) are complete.
The Agency is seeking federal approval to have all  transitions completed by January 1, 2018.
 The Agency will conduct a 30-day public comment period  from August 1, 2017 through  August 30, 2017.  The Agency will  consider all public comments received during the public notice period regarding  the proposed amendments.    The Agency has scheduled two public  meetings to solicit meaningful input on the proposed waiver amendments. The  meetings will be held in:
