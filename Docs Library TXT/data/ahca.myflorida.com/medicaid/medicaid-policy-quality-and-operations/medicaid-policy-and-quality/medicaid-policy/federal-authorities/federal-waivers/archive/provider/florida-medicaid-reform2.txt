Florida Medicaid Reform Health Plan Expansion Application

Please  be advised that health plan expansion requests received after June 1, 2012, are  not likely to be fully reviewed and approved prior to the release of the  procurement documents for Statewide Medicaid Managed Care.

Health plans that already serve Medicaid enrollees through a Reform plan may now apply to expand services to other Reform counties. The counties are Clay, Baker, Nassau, Duval and Broward. Plans that seek to expand to Clay, Baker or Nassau must serve all three counties.
The expansion application requires updates on any information that has changed since execution of the Reform plan contract the plan's original Reform application as well as new information for the expansion counties.
