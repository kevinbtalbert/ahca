Florida Medicaid’s PAC Waiver Changes












Florida Medicaid’s PAC Waiver Changes
The 2017 Legislature amended the law to allow individuals  who are diagnosed with AIDS to obtain and maintain Medicaid coverage without  the need for enrollment in the PAC Waiver. This  transition occurred on January 1, 2018. 
In order to qualify for Florida Medicaid, an  individual must meet the following  criteria:

Confirmed diagnosis of AIDS
AIDS-related  opportunistic infection
Income at  or below 222% of the federal poverty level (or 300% of the federal benefit  rate)
Assets  that do not exceed $2,000 (individual) or $3,000 (couple)
Hospital  level of care

Most recipients previously enrolled in  the PAC Waiver receive their medical, prescribed drugs, and acute care services  from a Statewide Medicaid Managed Care - Managed Medical Assistance (MMA)  health plan. There is no  change in how these individuals receive MMA services unless they choose to  change plans. With the advances that have been made over the last decade in the  treatment of HIV and AIDS, the majority of the people who were on the PAC Waiver did not use or need the  home and community-based services offered through the waiver. As such, the  recipients in the PAC Waiver who were only receiving case management services, specialized medical equipment  and supply services, and/or restorative massage services and did not need additional home and  community-based services in order to safely remain in the community, were dis-enrolled from  the PAC Waiver, but kept  their Medicaid coverage. This means no loss in services – they can continue to  have access to their medications, see their doctors, and receive case  management from their current MMA plan.
The recipients in the PAC  Waiver who were receiving  more than case management services, specialized medical equipment and supply services, and/or restorative  massage services through the PAC Waiver and who continued to need home and  community-based services in order to live safely in the community transitioned into the Statewide  Medicaid Managed Care Long-term Care (LTC) program for their home and  community-based service needs. These recipients continue to maintain Medicaid  eligibility and have access to their prescribed drugs and doctors through their  current MMA plan. They also are  continuing to  receive home and community-based services, provided through an LTC plan. The  Agency provided  these individuals with an opportunity to choose an LTC plan that best met their needs. The LTC  program offers a more robust benefit package than the PAC Waiver, including  enhanced case management standards and expanded benefits. The LTC program also  offers recipients an opportunity to receive care/services through a program  with enhanced quality outcome measures.
