Examples of activities and  projects include the following:

Florida Payment Error Rate  Measurement (PERM)

Florida is one of 17 States in a three-year  cycle randomly selected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  for the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) initiative for Federal Reporting  Year (RY) 2021 (July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020). This will be Florida’s fifth  time participating in the PERM initiative.   (The four previous cycle measurements were in 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017.)  For RY 2021, CMS will measure Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) claim payments,  managed care capitation and premium payments made on behalf of beneficiaries,  as well as eligibility determinations made under the Medicaid and CHP programs.
