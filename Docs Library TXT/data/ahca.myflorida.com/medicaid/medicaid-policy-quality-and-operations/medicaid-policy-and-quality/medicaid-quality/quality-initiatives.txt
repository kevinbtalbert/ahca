Quality InitiativesSMMC Quality Initiatives DashboardsUnder the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) program, the Agency and managed care plans are working with stakeholders to develop and streamline interventions related to Agency goals of reducing Potentially Preventable Hospital Events and improving Birth Outcomes.  The focus is on implementing evidence-based interventions using data to drive change.  In order to make these data easily accessible, the Agency has developed dashboards showing Potentially Preventable Events and Birth Outcomes data by Region, Health Plan, and Hospital.  These data and the methodologies for the dashboards are available at the following link:Quality Initiatives DashboardPotentially Preventable Events (PPE) Weights and NormsSMMC Quality Initiatives Stakeholder MeetingIn response to interest expressed by stakeholders in the quality initiatives and interventions that the managed care plans are conducting, the Agency hosted an in-person meeting to provide information on the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) quality initiatives related to Agency goals of reducing Potentially Preventable Events and improving Birth Outcomes.
