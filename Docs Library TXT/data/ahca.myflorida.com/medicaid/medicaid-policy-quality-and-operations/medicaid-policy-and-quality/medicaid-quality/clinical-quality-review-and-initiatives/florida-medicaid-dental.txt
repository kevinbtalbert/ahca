 Dental Care: Why It's ImportantIt is important for babies, children, and adults to see a dentist at least twice a year. The earlier children see a dentist, the healthier their gums and teeth will stay for their whole life. Children should begin seeing a dentist by age 1, even if they do not have teeth yet.Problems with teeth and gums can be avoided by seeing a dentist early in life and on a regular basis. Brushing, flossing and avoiding sugary foods and drinks can help with healthy teeth and gums.If a tooth problem does occur, it can have serious effects on your overall health. Tooth problems can also cause problems like not being able to bite and chew food, problems in school, or missing school because of pain.
