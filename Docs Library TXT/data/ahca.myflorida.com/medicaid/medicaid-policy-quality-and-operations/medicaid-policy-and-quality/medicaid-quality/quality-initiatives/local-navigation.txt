FLORIDA AWARD PROGRAM FOR SAFELY REDUCING CESAREAN SECTIONS 

FLORIDA’S AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION   AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
in partnership with  Florida Perinatal Quality Collaborative and the Florida Hospital Association
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION



OverviewThe Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and  the Florida Department of Health commend hospitals for achieving the Healthy  People 2020 (HP2020) target goal of 23.9 percent for first-time low-risk,  primary C-sections as a milestone of success. The program aligns with federal  and state efforts for improving maternal and infant health outcomes. Research  reveals that once a woman has a cesarean, she has a greater chance of having a  C-section for subsequent births, increasing her risk of major birth complications.  For the baby, some of the consequences can include longer hospital stays in the  neonatal intensive care unit, as well as higher rates of respiratory infection.  Stakeholders are focused on ensuring quality care for mothers and babies by  encouraging safe deliveries to help reduce unnecessary primary C-sections.
