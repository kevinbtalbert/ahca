MEDS-AD 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver












MEDS-AD 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver
The program provides assistance for people who are 65 years of  age or older or who have a disability, and who have resources below $5,000 for  an individual and $6,000 for a couple and whose income at or below 88 percent  of the federal poverty level. Those enrolled in the waiver will receive all  Medicaid state plan services.
Medication Therapy Management Program 
The Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency), through an  agreement with the University of Florida, provides Medication Drug Therapy  Management Program services to Medicaid recipients assigned to the MEDS-AD  Waiver program. The goals of the program are to improve the quality of care and  prescribing practices based on best-practice guidelines, improve patient  adherence to medication plans, reduce clinical risk, and lower prescribed drug  costs and the rate of inappropriate spending for certain Medicaid prescription  drugs.
Evaluation 
The Agency has contracted with the Florida State University to  conduct an independent evaluation of the Medication Therapy Management (MTM)  program   authorized under Florida’s section 1115 MEDS-AD  Research and Demonstration Waiver approved by the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services.
