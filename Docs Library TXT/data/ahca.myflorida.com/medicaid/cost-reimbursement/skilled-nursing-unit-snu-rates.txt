Skilled Nursing Unit (SNU) Rates











Medicaid Reimbursement RatesThese are rates which Medicaid reimburses Medicaid participating hospitals licensed under part I of chapter 395 for the provision of skilled nursing services. These rates are made on the basis of the average nursing home payment for those services in the county in which the hospital is located. If a hospital is located in a county that does not have a nursing home, the payment to the hospital will be the average nursing home service payment for the surrounding counties. Skilled nursing unit services are limited to 30 days for each Medicaid recipient unless prior authorization has been granted by the Department (AHCA).Rates published are effective as of the first day of the rate semester (January 1st/July 1st). This website is not updated for increases or decreases in rates due to revisions to cost data (such as amended cost reports or audits). For individual updated hospital rates, please contact your local Medicaid field offices or AHCA Medicaid Cost Reimbursement at (850) 412-4101.2023October 1, 2023
