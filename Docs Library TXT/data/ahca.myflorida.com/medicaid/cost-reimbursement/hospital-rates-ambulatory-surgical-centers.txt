Hospital Rates/Ambulatory Surgical Centers











Medicaid Reimbursement RatesThese are rates which Medicaid reimburses Medicaid participating hospitals for services provided on a fee for service basis to Medicaid recipients. This includes rates based on Legislative directions provided in the General Appropriations Act for each state fiscal year, which may exempt certain hospitals from rate reimbursement ceilings.Effective July 1, 2005, the cost of exempting certain hospitals from reimbursement ceilings is included in the capitation rates paid to Medicaid managed care organizations.Rates published are effective as of the first day of the rate semester (January 1st/July 1st). Effective July 1, 2011, rates are to be set once a year every July 1st. This Web site is not updated for increases or decreases in rates due to revisions to cost data (such as amended cost reports or audits).Effective July 1, 2013, the Agency will be implementing a new hospital inpatient payment method utilizing Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) for Florida Medicaid.  With this reimbursement change, there will no longer be any hospital inpatient per diem rates posted.  The only exception is for the State Mental Health Hospitals which will continue to be reimbursed per diem.  Hospital inpatient DRG rate worksheets will be posted instead of per diems.Effective July 1, 2017, the Agency will be implementing a new hospital outpatient payment method utilizing Enhanced Ambulatory Patient Groups (EAPGs) for Florida Medicaid.
