JulyPlease note: For state fiscal year (SFY) 2018-19, the Florida Legislature through the General Appropriations Act, appropriated non-recurring funding for the Nursing Home Prospective Payment System, specifically to fund increases to direct care reimbursement, nursing home rate enhancements by increasing the quality incentive pool and the transition to the prospective payment system, to be effective October 1, 2018. This was one-time, non-recurring funding that expired June 30, 2019. The July 1, 2019 Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates, and subsequently the hospice room & board rates, were re-calculated to reflect this decrease in non-recurring funding.
