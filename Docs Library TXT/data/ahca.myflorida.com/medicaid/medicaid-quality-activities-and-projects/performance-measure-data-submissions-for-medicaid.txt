Performance Measure Data Submissions for Medicaid
 The Agency monitors the Medicaid health  plans’ performance through a combination of HEDIS,  Adult and  Child Core Set, and Agency-defined performance measures. These can be used to  compare the performance of Medicaid health plans.
HEDIS measures are developed by the National  Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which is a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving  health care quality. NCQA develops quality standards and performance measures  for a broad range of health care entities. These are the measures and standards  that AHCA, like most managed care organizations, uses to help identify  opportunities for improvement. 
Adult[  ] and Child  Core Set[  ] measures are developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), which is a federal agency within the United States Department  of Health and Human Services that administers the Medicare program and works in  partnership with state governments to administer the Medicaid program.
Agency-defined measures are developed by the  Agency for Health Care Administration and are used for areas of focus for which  no national measures are available. The Agency posts separate technical  specifications manuals for
