Medicaid Reform Performance Measure Selection












 Medicaid Reform Performance Measure Selection 
As part of Florida's Medicaid  Reform initiative, the Agency sought to review and amend the performance measures historically required for health plans contracting with the Agency to better assess the quality and effectiveness of the health care services. Public input was sought and received from interested parties,  including health care advocates, providers, and State of Florida sister agencies, culminating in the final list of adopted measures.
The links below provide documents distributed at public workshops held on October 6, 2006, and October 26, 2006. Also provided is a compilation of stakeholder comments the Agency received during the performance measures development process.
