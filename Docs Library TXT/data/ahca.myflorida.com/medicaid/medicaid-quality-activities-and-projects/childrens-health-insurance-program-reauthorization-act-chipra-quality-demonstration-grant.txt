Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) Quality Demonstration Grant











Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) Quality Demonstration GrantOverviewIn February 2010 as part of the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded 10 quality demonstration grants, funding 18 states, to improve healthcare quality and delivery systems for children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  Under this grant opportunity, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) were jointly awarded $11,277,361 for work to be completed over the subsequent 5-year period.In 2014 the Florida and Illinois CHIPRA partnership was granted a one-year no-cost extension (NCE) to continue work with funds remaining from the original grant period.  The extension expires in February 2016.GoalsTo achieve the overarching goal of the grant of improving child health and child health outcomes, Florida and Illinois have undertaken a number of initiatives in four key federal priority categories Category A  - Experimenting with and evaluating the use of quality measures to improve child health care;Category B  - Promoting the use of Health Information Technology (HIT) in the delivery of care for children;Category C  - Evaluating provider-based models which improve the delivery of Medicaid/CHIP children's health care services; andCategory E  - Assessing the utility of other innovative approaches to enhance child health care quality.Florida’s WorkCategory A-  The Agency contracted with the University of Florida to collect, aggregate, and report performance measures in the CHIPRA Initial Core Set of Children’s Health Care Quality Measures related to the Category A CHIPRA Grant requirements. For more information, please review the Agency’s contract with the University by clicking on the link provided at the bottom of this page.Category B  - The Florida CHIPRA team worked with the state’s HIE staff to invest significant efforts in engaging child-serving providers in the state’s Direct Secure Messaging (DSM) and Hybrid Patient Look-Up (PLU) services to satisfy requirements in Category B of the Grant.Category C-  The Agency arranged for the facilitation of the Florida Pediatric Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Project to achieve goals set in Category C of the Grant. The University of Florida’s Institute of Child Health Policy provided an evaluation of the program. Sheri Eisert, Ph.D. and Ryan Brenn, RN, MPH with the University of South Florida, College of Public Health conducted a cost study of the program.Category E  - To achieve results in Category E of the CHIPRA Grant, Florida worked very closely with the Florida Perinatal Quality Collaborative (FPQC) in several areas including; Reducing Non-Medically Indicated Deliveries (NMID) by less than 39 weeks, and The Golden Hour Part I: Delivery Room Management which was fully funded by the Grant. This is the only category that Florida is working on as part of the one-year NCE. For more information please visit Quality Improvement Initiatives and More. Consulting, Collaboration, and EvaluationThe Agency has contracted with Health Management Associates (HMA), Inc. to provide professional consulting services in support of CHIPRA as well as facilitate collaboration with our partner state of Illinois.  For more information about HMA’s consulting services and the evaluation of the Grant, please review the Health Management Associates contract by clicking on the link provided at the bottom of this page.As part of the HMA’s work on the CHIPRA Grant, the following website is maintained with all Florida and Illinois CHIPRA Grant-related information and documents including all reports submitted as part of the Grant to CMS.The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is leading the national evaluation of the CHIPRA Grant.
