Certified EHR Technology: Eligible Professionals
















Certified EHR Technology: Eligible Professionals 
The Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program requires the use of Certified Electronic Health Record Technology (CEHRT). Standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for EHR technology have been adopted by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.  EHR technology must be certified by an ONC-Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ONC-ATCB) in order to qualify for the incentive payments. The Certified Health IT Product List is available  here.
For Program Years 2020 and 2021, all providers must attest using the 2015 Edition CEHRT.
