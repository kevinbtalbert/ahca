  for more detailed information.
The  Rule operationalizes the term unable to fully implement as:

Software  development delays
Missing or  delayed software updates
Being  unable to implement 2014 CEHRT for the full reporting period
Unable to  train staff, test the updated system, or put new workflows in place because of  delays associated with installation of 2014 CEHRT
Unable to  meet Stage 2 summary of care measures because the recipient of transmittals  was impacted by 2014 CEHRT issues

Reasons not recognized in the final rule are:

Financial  issues
Inability  to meet one or more measures
Staff  turnover and changes
Provider  waited too long to engage a vendor
Refusal  to purchase the requisite software updates
Providers  who fully implemented 2014 Edition CEHRT and can report in 2014

The  CEHRT technology edition used determines the Meaningful Use Stage and measures  and Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) to be reported.
