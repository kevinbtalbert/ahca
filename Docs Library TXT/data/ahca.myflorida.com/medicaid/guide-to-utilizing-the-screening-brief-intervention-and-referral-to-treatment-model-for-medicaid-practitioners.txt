Florida Medicaid added SBIRT coverage to promote early screening, brief intervention, and referral services by physicians and physician extenders in primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other community medical settings. SBIRT reimbursement provides the opportunity for early intervention with at-risk adolescent and adult substance users before more severe consequences occur.Screening quickly assesses the severity of substance use and identifies the appropriate level of treatment.Brief intervention focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and motivation toward behavioral change.Referral to treatment provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment with access to specialty care.The following provider types can be reimbursed for SBIRT services in accordance withRule 59G-4.002 Provider Reimbursement Schedules and Billing Codes, and the Florida Medicaid
