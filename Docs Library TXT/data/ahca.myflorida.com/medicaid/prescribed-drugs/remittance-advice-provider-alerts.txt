Additionally, the FDA is also requiring safety information about the risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, death, and slowed or difficult breathing be added to the boxed warning of these products.Florida Medicaid, in response to the FDA safety guideline recommendations, will adopt the minimum age limitation of 18 years of age on codeine and hydrocodone containing prescription cough and cold medicines, effective May 14, 2018. The list of FDA recommended products are included as a reference below.List of Prescription Cough and Cold Medicines Containing Codeine:codeine, chlorpheniraminecodeine, phenylephrine, promethazinecodeine, promethazinecodeine, pseudoephedrine, tripodineList of Prescription Cough and Cold Medicines Containing Hydrocodone:hydrocodone, guaifenesinhydrocodone, pseudoephedrine, guaifenesinhydrocodone, chlorpheniraminehydrocodone, chlorpheniramine, pseudoephedrinehydrocodone, homatropineSource: U.S. Food & Drug AdministrationFebruary 13, 2018Substance Use Disorder Treatment Options and PreventionGovernor Rick Scott has declared the opioid epidemic a state of emergency in Florida (see Executive Order 17-146). In response to the opioid crisis, the Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) is implementing provisions under the Florida Medicaid program to assist in the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders.Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral health therapy and medications to treat substance use disorders. Florida Medicaid covers an array of behavioral health therapies and prescribed drugs (e.g., Naltrexone, Buprenorphine, Methadone, etc.) to treat substance use disorders and does not limit the length of time recipients may receive treatment.Medication-Assisted Treatment: The Agency has eliminated all prior authorization requirements for the following medication-assisted treatment options under Florida Medicaid:Effective February 5, 2018, Florida Medicaid will reimburse for a 7-day supply of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) film or buprenorphine tablets (for pregnant or nursing mothers) without prior authorization. This will allow induction therapy to start immediately. Providers will be required to request prior authorization for continued therapy after the initial 7-day induction period. All prior authorization forms and criteria for prescribed drugs may be found here: http://ahca.myflorida.com/medicaid/Prescribed_Drug/preferred_drug.shtmlNaltrexone tabletsVivitrol (naltrexone) injectable – for recipients ages 18 years of age and older diagnosed with alcohol and/or opioid dependence.Additional Changes Related to Prescribed Drugs: Florida Medicaid has or will implement the following additional changes to prescribed drugs benefit:Systems modifications:Created a prior authorization form consistent with the guidelines and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Effective February 26, 2018, prescriptions for short acting narcotics, for the treatment of acute pain, will be limited to a maximum of 7-day supply. Prescribers may request an increase in the 7-day supply through the prior authorization process when medically necessary.Effective March 26, 2018, prescriptions for opioids for patients who are new to opioid treatment will be limited to a maximum dose equivalent to 90 milligrams of morphine per day.Prevent Florida Medicaid reimbursement for two or more long acting opioids prescribed simultaneously.Alert pharmacists when an opioid and a benzodiazepine are prescribed in combination (this applies in the fee-for-service delivery system)Require prescribers order a short acting opioid prior to consideration of a prescription for a long acting opioidFor recipients enrolled in a Medicaid health plan, services are reimbursed by the plan in accordance with their established agreements/contracts with network providers. In no instance may the health plan impose limitations or exclusions more stringent than those specified in Florida Medicaid coverage policies. In any instance when compliance with provisions in the Florida Medicaid promulgated rules in Chapter 59G, F.A.C. conflicts with the terms of the health plan contract, the contract prevails. For additional information, please contact the plan directly.February 1, 2018Influenza Antiviral TreatmentFlorida Medicaid covers brand name Tamiflu capsules for all ages and Tamiflu suspension for recipients 12 years of age and under.  Due to the increased influenza activity levels across the state and to allow greater access to antiviral treatment for eligible Florida Medicaid recipients who are experiencing onset of illness from the influenza virus, Florida Medicaid has added coverage of the generic formulation of Tamiflu which is Oseltamivir. Oseltamivir capsules for all ages and Oseltamivir suspension for recipients ages 12 and under, will now be covered through May 1, 2018.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends antiviral treatment be administered as early as possible after influenza illness onset. Ideally, treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients.For recipients enrolled in a Medicaid health plan, prescribed drug services are reimbursed by the plan in accordance with their established agreements/contracts with network providers. In no instance may the health plan impose limitations or exclusions more stringent than those specified in Florida Medicaid Coverage Policies. For additional information, please contact the plan directly.2017May 17, 2017New Requirement for Billing Immunizations CodesEffective October 1, 2017, Florida Medicaid providers who administer vaccines to Florida Medicaid recipients ages 0 through 20 years, will be required to submit both, the vaccine product Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code as well as the vaccine administration CPT code on the claim in order to receive reimbursement from Florida Medicaid through the fee-for-service delivery system.  If more than one vaccine is administered during the same visit, each vaccine code and an administration code for each vaccine must be submitted on the claim form.Florida Medicaid providers who receive vaccine products through the Vaccine For Children program for recipients ages 0 through 18 years are eligible to receive reimbursement for the administration of the vaccine from Florida Medicaid.  The vaccine product code will be reimbursed at $0.00, and the vaccine administration code will be reimbursed in accordance with Rule 59G-4.002, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.).Florida Medicaid providers who administer vaccines to recipients ages 19 and 20 years, must also include both CPT codes on the claim.  Florida Medicaid providers will receive reimbursement for the vaccine product plus the administration fee for each vaccine in accordance with Rule 59G-4.002, F.A.C.The following vaccine administration CPT codes (for ages 0 through 20 years) have been added to the 2017 Immunization Fee Schedule for billing purposes in the Florida Medicaid Management Information System:90460 - Immunization administration through 18 years of age via any route of administration with counseling by physician or other qualified health care professional first or only component of each vaccine or toxoid administered.90471 - Immunization administration (includes percutaneous, intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular injections) one vaccine single or combination vaccine/toxoid.90472 - Each additional vaccine (single or combination vaccine/toxoid).  List separately in addition to code for primary procedure.90473 - Immunization administration by intranasal or oral route one vaccine single or combination vaccine/toxoid.90474 - Each additional vaccine single or combination vaccine/toxoid.  List separately in addition to code for primary procedure.For recipients enrolled in a health plan, Medicaid services are billed directly to the health plan using their established policies.  For additional information, please contact the plan directly.2016September 23, 2016Proton Pump Inhibitors Prolonged UseIn 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that available data showed that patients at highest risk for fractures were those who received high doses of prescription proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or used a PPI for one year or longer.  The FDA also communicated through a drug safety bulletin that patients treated with PPIs for longer than five months were at higher risk of infections and that long-term use of PPIs could be associated with lower magnesium levels.  The Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) published a Medicaid health care alert on April 1, 2011 with this information, along with revised coverage guidelines based upon the FDA recommendations.The purpose of this alert is to notify prescribers and pharmacies of an exception to the daily dosing limits of PPIs that has been recommended by the Agency’s Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Board.  The DUR Board recommended that patients with a history of Barrett’s esophagus, bariatric surgery, gastric or esophageal malignancy, or hypersecretory condition (such as Zollinger/Ellison), be automatically approved for chronic therapy (longer than six months).  An automatic prior authorization is in place to override the 6-month limit for patients who meet the above criteria.  Providers prescribing PPIs in excess of the limits, and for other diagnoses specified above, will be required to submit a prior authorization request to the Agency’s pharmacy benefits manager if the recipient is receiving services through the fee-for-service delivery system.  Please refer to the clinical criteria posted on the Agency’s website: http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/Prescribed_Drug/drug_criteria.shtml.For recipients enrolled in a health plan, prescribers should contact the health plan directly for prior authorization requirements for PPIs.July 8, 2016New Oral Metoclopramide Safe Dosing LimitationsMetoclopramide carries a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia, which may be irreversible. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dose. Treatment with metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare cases where therapeutic benefit is thought to outweigh the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia.Beginning October 2016, the Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) will be implementing the following limitations for oral metoclopramide:A maximum limit of 40 mg per day for recipients under the age of 18 yearsA maximum limit of 60 mg per day for recipients ages 18 and olderA maximum of 12 continuous weeks of therapy for recipients of all agesProviders prescribing oral metoclopramide in excess of the limits specified above will be required to submit a prior authorization request to Magellan Medicaid Administration, Inc. if the recipient is receiving services through the fee-for-service delivery system. For recipients enrolled in a health plan, prescribers should contact the health plan directly for prior authorization requirements for this drug.2015December 4, 2015Codeine Restrictions for Recipients Under the Age of Six YearsDuring the June 27, 2015, Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Board meeting, the DUR members recommended that the Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) consider updating the coverage of codeine-containing products for children under the age of 6 years by following the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations.  The Agency accepted the DUR Board’s recommendation.  In February 2013, the FDA added a contraindication and boxed warning[  ] regarding the risk of codeine-containing products for pediatric post-operative pain management following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. In addition, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Chest Physicians recommend against the use of codeine to treat cough in pediatric patients. The FDA is also investigating the possible risks of codeine-containing cough and cold preparations in children under the age of18 years. (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm453125.htm)  To address these safety concerns, products containing codeine will now be restricted for Florida Medicaid recipients who are under the age of six years.Alternative treatments for post-operative pain management include Acetaminophen liquid 160mg/5ml and Ibuprofen 100mg/5ml. September 24, 2015Pharmaceutical & Therapeutics Board Committee Meeting PostponementThe Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) has postponed the Pharmaceutical & Therapeutics Committee meeting scheduled for Friday, September 25, 2015 in Tampa, Florida. The Agency will post information when the meeting has been rescheduled. Thank you and we apologize for any inconvenience.July 24, 2015Epinephrine Auto-Injectors Preferred Drug Status ChangeThe Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee recommended at the June 26, 2015 meeting, to add Auvi-Q® 0.3mg and 0.15mg (epinephrine auto-injectors) to the Florida Medicaid Preferred Drug List (PDL) and to remove EpiPen® 0.3 mg 2-Pak and EpiPen® Jr. 0.15mg 2-Pak auto-injectors from the PDL. The Agency for Health Care Administration has accepted the P&T Committee’s recommendation. However, in order to facilitate this transition for prescribers, pharmacies, and patients, the Agency will continue to reimburse for EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr. ® without the need for prior authorization through September 22, 2015. Here are available resources which may assist individuals in becoming more familiar with the Auvi-Q® auto injector delivery system:A physician fact sheet is available at: https://www.auvi-q.com/hcp/resourcesA patient brochure is available at: https://www.auvi-q.com/pdf/Patient-Information.pdf[  ]Additional resources including a video demonstration of how to use the Auvi-Q self- injector device is available at: https://www.auvi-q.com/July 10, 2015J7302 for Liletta and Mirena Intra-Uterine Contraceptive DevicesLiletta, a new intra-uterine contraceptive device, is now covered by Florida Medicaid.  This device contains the same main ingredient as Mirena, (levonorgestrel).  Both products have been assigned the same HCPC code, J7302.  For that reason, a modifier will be used to distinguish Liletta from Mirena. When billing for Liletta, use J7302 and modifier SC.When billing for Mirena, continue to use J7302.June 30, 2015Coverage Change for Palivizumab (Synagis®)Effective July 1, 2015, the maximum number of palivizumab prophylaxis doses reimbursed for eligible recipients under the age of two will be five doses per respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season.This change aligns with the current American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated guidance for palivizumab prophylaxis for RSV infection and was approved by the Florida Medicaid Drug Utilization Review Board at the June 27, 2015 meeting.The remaining eligibility criteria for palivizumab prophylaxis of RSV will remain unchanged and may be viewed on the Agency for Health Care Administration’s website in the

If the use of chronic opioid therapy is deemed appropriate, guidelines recommend starting with a low dose, short acting, as needed opioid and individualizing the dosing.  Overlapping use of more than one long acting opioid is a potentially inappropriate prescription practice that may be associated with adverse outcomes related to opioid usage.ReferencesLiu Y, Logan JE, Paulozzi LJ, et al. Potential Misuse and Inappropriate Prescription Practices Involving Opioid Analgesics Am J Manag Care 2013;19(8):648-658February 19, 2015Pharmacy System Retroactive PricingDrug manufacturers may increase their medications’ prices at any time throughout the year.  In some instances, the effective date of the price change is loaded retroactively in the Florida Medicaid pharmacy system, which means that pharmacy providers could be underpaid for a claim after the price change is updated in the system.  This is a reminder that pharmacies have one year from the date of service to reverse and rebill claims in order to receive the correct payment from Florida Medicaid.  Please note this only applies to pharmacy claims for recipients not enrolled in a managed care plan.2014November 20, 2014Skeletal Muscle RelaxantsSkeletal muscle relaxants are a heterogeneous group of medications. Based on their mechanism of action, FDA labeled indications and clinical practice; they can be divided into two main categories. Antispastics used to treat spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes such as cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Chronic therapy with these agents, including baclofen and tizanidine may be warranted in some patients with chronic spasticity.  The other category is antispasmodics which are indicated for muscle spasm associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions unrelated to the central nervous system.   The most commonly prescribed antispasmodic agents are carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxolone, and methocarbamol.  These agents do not act on motor neurons or on the muscle itself.  Their mode of action is primarily in the brain and perhaps spinal reflexes to relax skeletal muscles by unknown mechanisms.  Therapy with these agents should be utilized only for short periods (treatment beyond 2-3 weeks is not recommended) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for prolonged use has not been established. All skeletal muscle relaxants are associated with adverse effects including dizziness and drowsiness.   In comparison trials, no single agent has been proven to be superior to another.Below is a table indicating the typical starting dosages as well as the FDA approved maximum dosage.Skeletal Muscle RelaxantsMedicationTypical Starting DoseFDA Maximum DoseBaclofen5 mg three times daily80 mgParafon Forte(chlorzoxazone)500 mg four times daily3,000 mgFlexeril (cyclobenzaprine)5 mg three times daily30 mgAmrix (cyclobenzaprine ER)15 mg once daily30 mgSkelaxin (metaxalone)800 mg 3-4 times daily3,200 mgRobaxin (methocarbamol)1,500 mg four times daily8,000 mgZanaflex* (tizanidine)4 mg three times daily36 mgReferences:Chou R, Peterson K, Helfand M, et al.

Skeletal muscle relaxants.  Pharmacotherapy. 2008;28(2):207-13.November 20, 2014Statin Therapy in Diabetics - A look at recent guidelinesAccording to the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults, a high level of evidence supports the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy in persons with diabetes 40 to 75 years of age. Furthermore, statin therapy should also be initiated in diabetic patients without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors including family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia or albuminuria (Grade A).   These guidelines also suggest most adult patients with diabetes should have a fasting lipid profile measured at least annually. A recent review of Florida Medicaid recipient claims data revealed more than 60,000 diabetic patients between the ages of 40-75 were not receiving a statin and two thirds of all Florida Medicaid diabetes patients had not received a lipid profile in the last year.   Prescribers are encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of statin therapy in their diabetic patients between ages 40-75.As always, lifestyle modifications (healthy eating, weight control, increased physical activity) remain a critical component of health promotion and ASCVD risk reduction, both prior to and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines are not intended to be a comprehensive approach to lipid management for purposes other than ASCVD risk reduction. Guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of patients in most circumstances and are not a replacement for clinical judgment. The ultimate decision about care of a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of the circumstances presented by that patient. As a result, situations might arise in which deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate. These considerations notwithstanding, in caring for most patients, clinicians can employ the recommendations of these guidelines confidently to reduce the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in their diabetic patients.1 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.  Available at: https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/11/11/01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a.citation  Accessed August 28, 20142American Diabetes Association  Position Statement  Standards in Medical Care in Diabetes Diabetes Care 2014; 37:S14-S80; doi: 10.2337/dc14-S014  Available at:https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/Supplement_1  Accessed August 28, 2014. November 20, 2014Antibiotic Utilization for Upper Respiratory Tract InfectionsAs we approach cold and flu season in Florida, prescribers are reminded of the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in both pediatric and adult patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a “Get Smart” campaign (https://www.cdc.gov/grand-rounds/pp/2013/20131119-antibiotic-resistance.html) to address sound utilization of antibiotics in order to curb the epidemic of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, one of the initial activities of the CDC’s Get Smart campaign was to collaborate with various medical societies to develop guidelines for appropriate antibiotic use in upper respiratory tract infections.  The following links provide appropriate antibiotic treatment summaries for prescribers. Adults: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf[  ]Pediatrics: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf[  ]A recent publication in the journal “Pediatrics” defines three principles of judicious antibiotic principles for pediatric upper respiratory tract infections.  The first principle is to the determine the likelihood of a bacterial infection, the second principle is to weigh the benefits versus harms of antibiotics and the third principle is to implement judicious prescribing strategies, specifically noting the rates of pneumococcal resistance to macrolides and oral third-generation cephalosporins make these agents poor choices for treating most children with suspected bacterial URIs.Data specific to the southeastern United States show that Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to azithromycin was 55.9 percent (based on 68 isolates) in 2006 and had fallen to 40.4 percent susceptibility (based on 94 isolates) in 2010.  iHersh AL, Jackson MA, Hicks LA, et al.

As a result, the recommended starting dose of Lunesta is being decreased to 1 mg at bedtime. A study of Lunesta found that the previously recommended dose of 3 mg may cause impairment to driving skills, memory, and coordination that can last more than 11 hours after receiving an evening dose. Patients were often unaware they were impaired. Women and men are equally susceptible to impairment from Lunesta; therefore, the reduction in initial dosing is the same for both genders. If an increase in dosing is warranted to either 2 mg or 3 mg, there may be higher incidences in next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness. Patients should exercise extreme caution when taking a 3 mg dose. It is strongly advised against driving or engaging in other activities that require complete mental alertness the day after use. References:Lunesta (eszopiclone) package insert.
