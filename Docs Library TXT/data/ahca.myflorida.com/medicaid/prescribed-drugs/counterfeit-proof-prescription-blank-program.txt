Counterfeit-proof Prescription Blank Program











Counterfeit-proof Prescription Blank ProgramThe Florida Medicaid program, in accordance with section 409.912 (8)(a)5, Florida Statutes, requires medical practitioners to use a counterfeit-proof prescription blank produced by an approved vendor when writing hard copy prescription orders for Medicaid recipients for any covered service under the Florida Medicaid Prescribed Drug Services Program. The requirement is now effective, and all prescribers must use prescription blanks produced according to minimum requirements by one of the approved vendors. Additional information and the list of vendors are available on theMedicaid fiscal agent's Provider Web Portal. If you have questions, call Medicaid Program Integrity at 850-412-4600.
