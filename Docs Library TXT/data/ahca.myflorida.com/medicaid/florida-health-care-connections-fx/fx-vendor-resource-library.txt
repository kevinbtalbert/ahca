FX Vendor Resource LibraryThe Agency’s FX program is an ongoing process that involves the preparation of specifications for upcoming contracts. To protect the competitive nature of FX procurements, the Agency will not have any discussions related to the scope, evaluation, or negotiation of any current or future procurement with vendors or their representatives, other than the Agency’s SEAS Vendor, IV&V Vendor, and IS/IP Vendor, who are precluded from bidding on future FX contracts. Procurements are subject to s. 287.057(23), Florida Statutes, between the release of the solicitation and the end of the 72-hour period following the agency posting the notice of intended award.The FX standards and plans below establish project management and process standardization across the FX Program.Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO)
