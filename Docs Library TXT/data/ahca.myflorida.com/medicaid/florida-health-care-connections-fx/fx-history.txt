FX History











FX HistoryThe Agency is adapting to the changing landscape of health care administration and increased use of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) to improve the administration and operation of the Florida Medicaid Enterprise.The Florida Medicaid Management Information System (FMMIS) has historically been the central system within the Florida Medicaid Enterprise; functioning as the single, integrated system for claims processing and information retrieval. As the Medicaid program has grown more complex, the systems needed to support the Florida Medicaid Enterprise have grown in number and complexity.The Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) Procurement Project was re-named Florida Health Care Connections (FX) in the Summer of 2018. FX is a multi-year transformation to modernize the current Medicaid technology using a modular approach, while simultaneously improving overall Agency functionality and building better connections to other data sources and programs.As part of this transformation, the Agency submits an Advance Planning Document (APD) to CMS, which provides the data required to determine if Federal Financial Participation (FFP) is authorized – with the appropriate match rate – for the acquisition of automated data processing equipment and services. The timeline below provides information about the APDs the Agency has submitted to CMS and their respective response.February 2024 – Implementation APD Update (IAPDU)Summary:Update regarding the FX Core Systems Module pause.Revised Federal Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 budget.Module project updates and vendor contract updates.Revised FX Roadmap.Total (net) Request:Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2024 – decrease of ($22,114,963) – new total budget = $155,287,776FFY 2025 – increase of $31,204,266 – new total budget = $161,590,092State Fiscal Year (SFY): SFYs 2024, 2025FFYs covered are 2024 and 2025
