A technical correction has been made to the Annual Quarterly PC Reconciliation Report template. Column headers on the Reconciliation Report tab now reflect calendar quarters rather than fiscal quarters. This update is documented on the “Document Version Log” tab of the template. Plans should use the updated version of the template for the next quarterly submission due on 10-25-2023.10/25/2023PT 2023-087/7/2023
