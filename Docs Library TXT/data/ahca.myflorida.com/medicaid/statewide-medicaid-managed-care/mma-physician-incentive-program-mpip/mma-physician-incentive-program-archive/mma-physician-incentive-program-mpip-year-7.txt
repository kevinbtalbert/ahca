 MPIP Year 7: Qualified ProvidersBelow is a list of Primary Care Physicians and OB/GYNs by name, reported by the plans to the Agency, who meet MPIP Year 6 qualifying criteria prior to the implementation date. All specialist physicians serving members under the age of 21 qualify for the MPIP program and will not be listed on the Qualified Providers list. Specialists are encouraged to work with their respective health plans to submit claims for the MPIP enhanced rates when providing services to members under the age of 21. Qualified providers will begin to receive enhanced rates for dates of service beginning on or after the implementation date.During each year of MPIP, plans are required to reassess physician eligibility for the program six months after implementation. For MPIP Year 7, plans will be required to reassess physician eligibility for enhanced rates for dates of service beginning on or after April 1, 2023. This allows providers who become qualified after the October 1, 2022 implementation date a second opportunity to become eligible for MPIP. The Year 7 qualified provider list, available at the link below, will be updated after each reassessment.
