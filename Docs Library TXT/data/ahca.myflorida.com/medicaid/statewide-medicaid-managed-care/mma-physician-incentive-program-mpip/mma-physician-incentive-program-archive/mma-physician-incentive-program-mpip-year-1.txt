For MPIP Year 1, plans were required to reassess eligibility for enhanced rates for dates of service beginning on or after April 1, 2017. This allowed providers who became qualified after the October 1, 2016 implementation date a second opportunity to become eligible for MPIP. The Year 1 qualified provider list, available at the link below, reflects the updated reassessment.
