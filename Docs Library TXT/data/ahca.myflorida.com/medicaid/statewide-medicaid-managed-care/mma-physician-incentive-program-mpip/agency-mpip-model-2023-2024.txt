Providers who qualified for MPIP Year 7 (October 1, 2022 – September 30, 2023) through an Individual Health Plan MPIP (IHP Incentive Program) must continue to be qualified for the MPIP year beginning October 1, 2023. If any providers have newly qualified for MPIP under the 2023-2024 Agency MPIP model requirements, these providers must also be added for the MPIP year beginning October 1, 2023.MPIP Covered Physician Types:Pediatric Primary Care Physicians (including General Practitioners and Family Practitioners)OB/GYNsSpecialist Physicians for all services provided to enrollees under the age of twenty-one (21) years.Plans must reimburse both in and out-of-network Emergency Room physicians at the MPIP enhanced rates for services rendered to members under 21 years of age.Plans must reimburse all out-of-network Hospital-based Specialty physicians at the MPIP enhanced rates for services rendered to members under 21 years of age.2023-2024 MPIP - Qualified Providers:Below is a list of Primary Care Physicians and OB/GYNs by name, reported by the plans to the Agency, who meet the 2023-2024 Agency MPIP qualifying criteria prior to the implementation date. All specialist physicians serving members under the age of 21 qualify for the MPIP program and will not be listed on the Qualified Providers list. Specialists are encouraged to work with their respective health plans to submit claims for the MPIP enhanced rates when providing services to members under the age of 21. Qualified providers will begin to receive enhanced rates for dates of service beginning on or after the implementation date.During each year of MPIP, plans are required to reassess Primary Care and OB/GYN physician eligibility for the program six months after implementation. For MPIP 2023-2024, plans will be required to reassess physician eligibility for enhanced rates for dates of service beginning on or after April 1, 2024. This allows providers who become qualified after the October 1, 2023, implementation date a second opportunity to become eligible for MPIP. The 2023-2024 MPIP qualified provider list, available at the link below, will be updated after each reassessment.

Note: The October and April MPIP qualification windows do not apply to determining MPIP eligibility for specialty physicians. Therefore, there should not be a delay in specialty physicians receiving enhanced payments, even if they joined a plan network between October and April.If you are a provider contracted with a health plan to provide services and you feel that your name was omitted from the Qualified Providers List in error, please contact the plan directly. Plan contact information for providers can be found at the link below.
