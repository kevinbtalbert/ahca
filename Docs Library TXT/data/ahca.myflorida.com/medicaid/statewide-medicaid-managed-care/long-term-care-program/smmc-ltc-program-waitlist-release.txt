SMMC LTC Program Waitlist Release











SMMC LTC Program Waitlist ReleaseThe Department of Elder Affairs (DOEA) works with the Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) to manage the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) Long-Term Care (LTC) wait list.  Each month DOEA releases individuals from the wait list based on their score and frailty-based levels, in accordance with available enrollments as determined by the Agency for Health Care Administration.  Release from the wait list is not based on how long a person’s name is on the wait list.  When enrollment becomes available, the ADRC will contact persons on the wait list and begin the enrollment process.Persons who are not on Medicaid at the time they are released from the wait list must complete all required actions and provide all required documents to Department of Children and Families (DCF) for financial eligibility to be determined and to the DOEA for medical determination of eligibility before enrollment in the LTC program can happen.Priority Scores and RanksPriority score and rank are used to make sure the most fragile Floridians are offered Long-term Care (LTC) Program enrollment when it becomes available.  The
