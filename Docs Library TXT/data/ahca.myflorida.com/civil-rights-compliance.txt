Civil Rights Compliance












Welcome to the Agency for Health Care Administration's Civil Rights Compliance page. The Civil Rights Compliance Coordinator's ("CRCC") primary funtion is to coordinate the Agency's compliance with the requirements of civil rights laws which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.
Notice of Nondiscrimination Policy
