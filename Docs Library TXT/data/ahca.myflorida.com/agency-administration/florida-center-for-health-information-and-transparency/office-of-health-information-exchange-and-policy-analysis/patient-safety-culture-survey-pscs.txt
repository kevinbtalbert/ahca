The Agency for Health Care Administration was legislatively tasked with implementing the Patient Safety Culture Survey for all Florida Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgical Centers.  Patient Safety Culture is the collective beliefs, values, and norms shared by a healthcare organization or facility that support and promote patient safety. Patient safety culture can be measured by determining which overall behaviors and norms are rewarded, supported, expected, and accepted within a health care organization or facility. In accordance with s.  408.05(3)(d)(1) F.S., the Agency has developed a PSCS process, designed an informational webpage, developed a system application, and has successfully promulgated rule 59A-35.115, Patient Safety Surveys. Each facility’s required participation in this survey process is outlined in s. 395.1012(4) F.S.  The Agency encourages each facility to evaluate the results generated from the surveys to assess the current status of patient safety culture, identify strengths and areas of needed improvement, provide a higher quality of care, and increase accountability within the health care facilities. The survey data findings will be published as available in accordance with Section 408.05(3)(d)3., F.S.*FACILITY REGISTRATION WILL NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE UNTIL JANUARY 2025*  Ambulatory Surgical CentersGeneral InformationHospitals1.
