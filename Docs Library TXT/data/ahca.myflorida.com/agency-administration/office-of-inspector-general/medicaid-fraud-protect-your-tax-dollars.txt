Medicaid Fraud: Protect Your Tax Dollars











Report Medicaid FraudMedicaid Fraud and Abuse Online Complaint Form (to report suspected fraud and/or abuse in the Florida Medicaid system)Medicaid Fraud: Protect Your Tax DollarsWHY IT IS IMPORTANTThe Medicaid program is funded with both state and federal tax dollars. It is designed to pay for health care for low-income and vulnerable Floridians (children, pregnant women, disabled adults and seniors) who need care. When people get benefits they don’t deserve, or when providers are paid for services that were not supplied, it wastes your tax dollars and takes services away from those who need them.MEDICAID FRAUDMedicaid fraud means an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a health care provider or a Medicaid recipient with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to him or herself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under federal or state law related to Medicaid.Concerns associated with suspected Medicaid fraud by eligible Medicaid recipients may be reported to the Florida Department of Financial Services, Division of Public Assistance fraud hotline at 1-866-762-2237.Suspected Medicaid fraud by ineligible recipients may be reported to the Florida Department of Children and Families, Office of Public Benefits Integrity at https://www.myflfamilies.com/services/public-assistance/public-benefits-integrity.The Office of Medicaid Program Integrity of the Inspector General at the Agency for Health Care Administration accepts complaints associated with Medicaid billing fraud. These complaints may be filed online using the Medicaid billing fraud online complaint form or by telephone at 1-888-419-3456.To report suspected Medicaid fraud by health care providers you may also contact the Office of Attorney General at 1-866-966-7226 or file a complaint online at https://myfloridalegal.com.THINGS YOU CAN LOOK FORUpcodingProviders bill Medicaid using codes that describe the amount of time spent with the patient. If a patient sees a health care provider for ten (10) minutes on a simple matter and the provider bills for an hour-long, complex visit, that is upcoding.UnbundlingSome billing codes used by providers are all-inclusive and “bundle” several laboratory tests into one code. If the provider breaks the bundled code into several parts to achieve a higher reimbursement rate, that is unbundling. For example: A Lipid Panel is a laboratory test that includes three different component tests. Unbundling occurs when the three component tests are billed instead of the Lipid Panel.WHAT FRAUD LOOKS LIKEMost providers who commit Medicaid fraud fall into one or more of these categories:billing for patients who did not really receive services,billing for a service and/or equipment that wasn’t provided,billing for items and services that the patient no longer needs,overcharging for equipment or services,concealing ownership or associations in a related company,paying a “kickback” in exchange for a referral for medical services or equipment,billing more than once for the same service,using false credentials such as diplomas, licenses or certifications, orordering tests or prescriptions that the patient does not need.HOW TO REPORT FRAUDYou can help protect your tax dollars by reporting suspected fraud by phone, through the Internet or by regular mail. You can do this without giving your name, but if you agree to give your name and other contact information, that helps the investigators to obtain future information.Before you make a report, try to get as much information as possible, including:the name of the person you suspect of committing fraud. This might be a person receiving medical benefits or a health care professional hospital, nursing home, or other facility that provides Medicaid servicesthe Medicaid ID numberthe date of servicesthe amount of money involved, and/ora description of the acts that you suspect involve fraudWHAT YOU DO TO PREVENT FRAUDDo not give your Medicaid card number to anyone except your doctor, hospital or other health care providerDo not ask your doctor or other medical provider for medical care you do not need.Be suspicious if you are offered free screenings or tests in exchange for your Medicaid card number.Ask questions if someone wants you to have services or treatments that you feel you do not need. If necessary, get a second opinion from another health care provider.Do not accept money or gifts from anyone who offers to buy medicine that you have received through Medicaid.Those who report fraud may be entitled to a reward if they report a criminal case that results in a fine, penalty or forfeiture of property. To find out more, call the Attorney General at 1-866-966-7226. FS 409.9203 Rewards for reporting Medicaid fraud112.3187 Adverse action against employee for disclosing information of specified nature prohibited; employee remedy and relief - may be cited as the "Whistle-blower's Act."While committing significant resources to protect the public’s interest, the Attorney General’s Office will always welcome the assistance of the citizens in fighting against health care fraud.
