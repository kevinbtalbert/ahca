Please use the embedded links in the text below for more information.The Office of Plans and Construction (OPC) is responsible for ensuring that hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical centers, and intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled (ICF/DD) are designed and built to be safe, functional, and in compliance with the

 regulating the physical plant of these facilities. All proposed construction of new facilities and any and all additions, modifications, renovations, or refurbishment of the site, building, equipment or systems of all existing facilities must be approved by OPC prior to commencing any construction activity. Involving OPC early in the design process of new facilities and large projects is strongly encouraged to avoid costly delays.Our knowledgeable and experienced teams of architects and engineers are available to examine plans at various stages of development which include

 . Only the review and approval of stage III documents and subsequent revisions are required, but facilities are recommended to submit plans for stage I and stage II reviews for all but small projects where the design team has a high level of confidence in the code compliance of the design. Approval of stage II documents is a pre-requisite for receiving approval of an early construction request. Additionally, a stage III approval allows the project to continue under the applicable codes and standards in effect at time of approval for up to 12 months prior to commencing construction.
