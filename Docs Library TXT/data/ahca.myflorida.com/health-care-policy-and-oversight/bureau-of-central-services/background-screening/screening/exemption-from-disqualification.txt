Exemption from Disqualification:












Exemption from Disqualification:
In accordance with section 435.07, Florida Statutes, persons  disqualified from employment may be granted an exemption from disqualification.  The granting of an exemption does not change an individual’s criminal history.  It only provides eligibility for employment in a health care setting. An individual seeking an exemption must demonstrate by clear  and convincing evidence that an exemption from disqualification should be  granted. The application will be reviewed and a decision made once all relevant  documentation, listed in the Exemption Form Instructions below, has been received. A person is not eligible to apply for an Exemption from  Disqualification until:

At least 3 years have elapsed since the applicant for       exemption has completed or been lawfully released from confinement,       supervision or nonmonetary condition imposed by the court for
           all       disqualifying felonies 
        ;
The applicant for the exemption has completed or been       lawfully released from confinement, supervision or nonmonetary condition       imposed by the court for
           all misdemeanors prohibited under any of the       statutes cited in this chapter or under similar statutes of other       jurisdictions 
        ;
The  applicant has
           paid the court-ordered amount in full  
        for any fee, fine,  fund, lien, civil judgment, application, cost of prosecution, trust or  restitution as part of the judgment and sentence for any disqualifying felony  or misdemeanor;
