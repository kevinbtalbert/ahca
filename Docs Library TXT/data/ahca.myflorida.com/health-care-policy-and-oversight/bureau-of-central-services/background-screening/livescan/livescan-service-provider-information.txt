Livescan Service Provider Information












Livescan Service Provider Information
All Level 2 screening requests must be submitted  electronically.
There are many Livescan sites available around the state from service providers listed on the FDLE site - some who offer mobile services  for onsite screening. We have requested information from each of these  service providers regarding their location, hours of operation, and fees and compiled a chart based on the information provided. This list is  continuously updated and reported within the Clearinghouse results website.  For more information,  visit the FDLE site.
Livescan devices (machines) may  be purchased/leased by providers who wish to handle their own fingerprint  capture. Several businesses offer machines (sale or lease) however, it is  important to assure that any selection is approved for submission through FDLE  and all requirements of fingerprint submission are met. For more information,  visit the FDLE site.
