Nursing Home Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Reinvestment Projects











Nursing Home Civil Money Penalty (CMP) Reinvestment ProjectsCivil Money Penalties (CMP) are monetary penalties (fines) imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) against nursing facilities that have failed to maintain compliance with federal requirements. A portion of these funds are returned to States and may be used for projects supporting activities that benefit nursing facility residents or that protect and improve their quality of life or care. CMP funds may be used for, but not limited to the following:TrainingTransition preparationCulture change/quality of lifeProjects that support resident and family councilsResident transition due to facility closure or downsizingThe Agency for Health Care Administration began this project in 2005 in an effort to use federal CMP funds (fines) to support innovative ideas that directly impact quality of care or quality of life of nursing home residents beyond minimum standards. The ideas proposed must be innovative to the facility, the state or to long-term care.Resources
