Hospitals











 HospitalsA hospital is a licensed facility that offers services more intensive than those required for room, board, personal services and general nursing care, and offers facilities and beds for use beyond 24 hours by individuals requiring medical, surgical, psychiatric, testing, diagnosis, treatment, or care for illness, injury, deformity, infirmity, abnormality, disease, or pregnancy. Also available are clinical laboratory services, diagnostic X-ray services, and treatment facilities for surgery, obstetrical care, or other definitive medical treatment of similar extent.A license issued by the Agency for Health Care Administration is required in order to operate a hospital. It is unlawful for a person to use or advertise to the public, in any way or by any medium whatsoever, any facility as a "hospital" unless such facility has first secured a license under the provisions of Chapter 395, Part I, Florida Statutes and Chapter 408, Part II, Florida Statutes. This licensure does not apply to veterinary hospitals or to commercial business establishments using the word "hospital" as a part of a trade name if no treatment of human beings is performed on the premises of such establishments.Hospitals must maintain state licensure but may choose to be Medicare certified and may choose to be accredited.Health Facility Reporting System



The Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) requires all licensees providing residential or inpatient services to use an Agency approved database for reporting its emergency status, planning or operations. The Agency approved database for reporting this information is the Health Facility Reporting System (HFRS).Notices/UpdatesSupplemental Licensure Information - Effective July 1, 2019, as a result of House Bill 21 (Chapter 2019-136, Laws of Florida) certain hospital programs and services are no longer subject to Certificate of Need review. As stated in this legislation, information currently found in Rules 59C-1.039, 59C-1.042, and 59C-1.044, F.A.C., remains in effect for the sole purpose of maintaining licensure requirements for the applicable services until licensure rules are adopted.

Accredited hospitals meeting Rule 59A-3.253(3), Florida Administrative Code, may be "deemed" to be in compliance with the licensure and certification requirements. Deemed hospitals are not scheduled for routine on-site licensure or recertification surveys, although periodic Life Safety Code inspections are still required. Facilities must provide a complete copy of the most recent survey report indicating continuation as an accredited facility in lieu of inspections. The survey report should include correspondence from the accrediting organization containing:The dates of the survey,Any citations to which the accreditation organization requires a response,A response to each citation,The effective date of accreditation,Any follow-up reports, andVerification of Medicare (CMS) deemed status, if applicable.Pursuant to section 395.0162, Florida Statutes, this report will become part of the facility file maintained by our office and therefore will be considered public record.  Facilities no longer accredited or granted accreditation status other than accredited or fail to submit the requested documentation will be scheduled for annual licensure and/or recertification surveys to be conducted by Agency field office staff.Statutory Authority: Section 408.811(2), 395.002(1), 395.0161(2), 395.003(2)(c), Florida StatutesAccrediting OrganizationWeb AddressDeemed for State LicensureDeemed for Medicare CertificationDNV Healthcarehttps://www.dnv.us/YesYesAccreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC)https://www.achc.org/YesYesThe Joint Commission (TJC)https://www.jointcommission.org/YesYesCommission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilitieshttps://www.carf.org/home/Yes, for Class IV hospitals onlyYes, for Class IV hospitals onlyThe Center for Improvement in Healthcare Qualityhttps://www.cihq.orgNoYesLicensure RequirementsLicensure Requirements - Overview for initial, renewal, change of ownership, and other changes to a license.Licensure FeesLicensed Hospital ProgramsApplications & Supporting FormsOnline Licensure – In addition to submitting license renewal applications online, licensees may also submit changes during the licensure period.
