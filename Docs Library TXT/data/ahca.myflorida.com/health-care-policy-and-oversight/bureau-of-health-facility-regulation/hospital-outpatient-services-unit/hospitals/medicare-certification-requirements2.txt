Medicare Certification Requirements











Medicare Certification RequirementsThe hospital must be inspected for compliance with the Conditions of Participation as directed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A facility seeking initial licensure and certification will receive two (2) inspections; one licensure survey before operation begins followed by a certification survey after the facility is fully operational. Psychiatric facilities require an additional certification of the Medicare special Conditions of Participation for Psychiatric Hospitals.Participation in the Medicare/Medicaid program(s) will depend upon an effective date recommended by the Agency for Health Care Administration. Federal regulations permit this date to be the date of initial certification if all federal requirements are met or the date an acceptable plan of correction or waiver request is received.Required Forms for Medicare CertificationFormDescription
