Licensure Requirements











Licensure RequirementsInitialThis includes previously unlicensed facilities and reactivation of an expired license. A hospital applicant must have a current project under review with the Agency's Office of Plans and Construction (OPC). A New Facility Form is required for all new facilities, including new premise hospitals per s.395.003(2)(a). Applicants should submit a hospital licensure application, fees, and supporting documents 60 to 120 days before the anticipated effective date. When all required information is received and acceptable, including successful completion of the OPC project, an initial licensure inspection will be scheduled. Licenses will be issued when documentation of a successful licensure inspection is complete and filed. Please note a valid license is required before patient care can be provided. A separate application is required for each facility located on separate premises.RenewalThe licensure application, renewal fee and supporting documents must be submitted to the Agency 120 to 60 days prior to the expiration date. A late fee of $50 per day, up to 50% of the licensure fee or $500 (whichever is less) will be assessed for any application not received 60 days prior to expiration. A renewal application will not be accepted if the hospital license is expired. A separate application is required for each facility located on separate premises. Renew Online - All renewal applicants must apply online by submitting the online licensure application, fees, and supporting documents electronically through the Agency's Online Portal.Change of Ownership (CHOW)Chapter 408.803, Florida Statutes defines "Change of ownership" as: an event in which 51 percent or more of the ownership, shares, membership, or controlling interest of a licensee is in any manner transferred or otherwise assigned. This does not apply to a licensee that is publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange. Also, a change solely in the management company or board of directors is not a change of ownership.A licensure application, fee and supporting forms must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the change of ownership. Before the application can be approved, a bill of sale or other closing document signed by the buyer and the seller and showing the effective date of the transfer must be received by the Agency. The Agency will not transfer the license to the proposed owner prior to the actual date of sale. A separate application is required for each facility located on separate premises.Other Change During the Licensure PeriodChanges to the name, addresses, licensed beds, or other designation or service requires a change application. Applications must be submitted 60 days prior to the change or will be subject to a $500 late fine per 59A-35.040(3), F.A.C. Any information regarding changes to personnel or controlling interest (that do not constitute a change of ownership) are required to be reported to the agency, and must be submitted within 21 calendar days from the effective date of the change, as required by s. 408.810(3), Florida Statutes. Changes must be reported by submitting a completed application.  Applications not received within 21 calendar days will be subject to a $500 late fine.Voluntary Termination of a LicenseA licensee must inform the agency not less than 30 days prior to the discontinuance of operation and comply with the requirements listed in Chapter 408.810(4), Florida Statutes.
