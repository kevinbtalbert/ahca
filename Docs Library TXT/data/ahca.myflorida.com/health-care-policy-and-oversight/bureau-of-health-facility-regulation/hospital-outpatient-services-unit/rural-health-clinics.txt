Rural Health Clinics











Rural Health ClinicsRural health clinics (RHC) is a Medicare certification program designed to increase access to quality care for rural residents by utilizing nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) under the medical direction of a physician. The clinic must be located in a non-urbanized and designated or certified shortage area. RHCs must employ a NP or PA, and have a NP, PA, or Certified Nurse-Midwife working at the clinic at least 50% of its operating hours. Additional requirements can be found below under Regulations/Guidance.There are two types of rural health clinics. The independent rural health clinic is a freestanding practice that is not part of a hospital, skilled nursing facility or home health agency. The provider based rural health clinic is an integral and subordinate part of a hospital, skilled nursing facility or home health agency.Notices/UpdatesNone at this timeLicense/Certification RequirementsApplication for Medicare certification includes submission of a completed application, required documentation, and successful completion of a survey.
