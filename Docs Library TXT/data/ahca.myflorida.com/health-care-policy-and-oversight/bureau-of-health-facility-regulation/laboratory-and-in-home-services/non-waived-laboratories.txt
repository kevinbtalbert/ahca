Non-Waived Laboratories











 Non-Waived Laboratories*If you are seeking information about professional licenses, please visit the Department of Health's web site at:https://floridasclinicallabs.gov/.All facilities, including physician offices, performing any clinical Laboratory testing, are required to obtain a federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certificate. Facilities performing any non-waived clinical Laboratory testing or testing using a microscope must also obtain a state clinical Laboratory license before the Laboratory is authorized to perform testing. Tests performed using a microscope are not waived. To determine whether a test is waived, see the List of Waived Tests at the federal web site: https://www.cms.hhs.gov/CLIA/10_Categorization_of_Tests.asp, which provides CLIA categorizations.The CLIA program separately bills the Laboratory for payment. CLIA fees should never be sent to the State of Florida.Notices/UpdatesEffective July 1, 2018, the Agency will discontinue the licensure program for non-waived laboratories.
