Certificate of Need (CON) Program Overview












Certificate of Need (CON) Program  Overview
The Certificate of Need program is a regulatory process that requires certain health care providers to obtain state approval before offering certain new or expanded services.   The CON program currently regulates hospices, freestanding inpatient hospice facilities, skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled. It does not regulate outpatient services, home health services, purchases of major medical equipment, assisted living facilities, and hospitals.
There are four CON batching cycles a year - two for Hospice and two for Nursing Homes and ICF/DDs. Most projects are reviewed on a competitive batching cycle review basis, and a letter of intent must be filed with the CON Office at least 30 days before an application is filed.  A letter of intent is not required for projects that will be given a non-competitive, expedited review.
Public hearings may be held on a CON application if requested by an applicant or a substantially affected party. CON decisions are rendered 60 days after an application is declared complete by the Agency. Notices of hearings, decisions and other actions regarding CON that are required by law are published in the Florida Administrative Register. Applicants or other affected parties may appeal a decision of the Agency according to the provisions of Rule 59C-1.012, Florida Administrative Code,  Section 408.039(5) and (6)  Florida Statutes (F.S.) and Chapter 120, F.S. 

The CON Office monitors implementation of an approved project until it is licensed.  CONs that were approved with conditions are monitored every year to assure that the required services are being provided.
Any questions regarding whether a project is subject to CON review or the CON process may be sent to  James McLemore or call at 850-412-4401.
Media Relations Contact for Reporters:Reporters are asked to contact the Agency's Media Relations Unit for information on CON applications, decisions, or any other Certificate of Need related issue at 850-412-3623.
