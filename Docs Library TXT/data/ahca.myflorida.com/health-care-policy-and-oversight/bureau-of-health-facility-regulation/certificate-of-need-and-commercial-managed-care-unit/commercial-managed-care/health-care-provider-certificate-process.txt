Upon receipt of an application and checks for renewal, the provider network is reviewed for compliance with Florida Statute and rule.MonitoringOngoing monitoring is accomplished through quarterly and annual grievance reports, annual risk management surveys, complaint information from the HMO Complaint Hotline, and investigations of subscriber quality of care complaints. In addition, HMOs are required to maintain accreditation from a nationally recognized accreditation organization approved by the Agency.ExpansionAn Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or prepaid health clinic may expand their geographic service area by submitting an expansion affidavit. When the affidavit is reviewed and deemed complete, a review is completed to review the provider network the health plan will use in the expanded area. The affidavit also affirms consistent compliance throughout the expanded network with Florida Statute and rule.AccreditationAccreditation is a process to measure how a health care organization performs using a nationally recognized set of quality standards. By looking at internal processes of monitoring and evaluating the health care given to members of HMOs, members are assured of quality services rendered in the most cost effective manner. Since 1992, Florida has required HMOs to be accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation organization whose standards have been approved by the Agency.The following organizations are approved in the state of Florida:National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)1100 13th Street NW, Suite 1000Washington, D.C. 20005(202)955-3500Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care(AAAHC)5250 Old Orchard Road, Suite 200Skokie, IL 60077(847)853-6060American Accreditation HealthCare Commission/URAC1220 L Street, NW, Suite 400Washington, D.C. 20005(202) 216 - 9010
