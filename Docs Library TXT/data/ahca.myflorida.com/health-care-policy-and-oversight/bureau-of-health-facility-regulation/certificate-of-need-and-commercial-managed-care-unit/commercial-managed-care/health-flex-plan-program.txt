Health Flex Plan Program











Health Flex Plan ProgramThe Health Flex Plan, established in Section 408.909, Florida Statutes, became effective July 1, 2002. The Legislature found that a significant proportion of the residents of this state are unable to obtain affordable health insurance coverage. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to expand the availability of health options for low-income uninsured state residents by encouraging health insurers, health maintenance organizations, health care provider sponsored organizations, local governments, health care districts or other public or private community-sponsored organizations to develop alternative approaches to traditional health insurance that emphasize coverage for basic and preventive health care services.County AvailabilityThe Health Flex Program is available with American Care, Inc. in Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Polk and St. Lucie counties.To find out more about the program in your area contact:American Care, IncPhone: (888) 777-2555Enrollment: (888) 779-2785Website: www.americancare.comEstablishment ApplicationThe Agency for Health Care Administration and the Department of Financial Services, Office of Insurance Regulation have jointly created an application package as an aid for HMOs, Health Care Providers and Insurers in preparing your application for the establishment of a Health Flex program.For additional information and the Health Flex Plan Program application and related forms, please view the following
