Assisted Living Facility











Assisted Living FacilityAn assisted living facility (ALF) is designed to provide personal care services in the least restrictive and most home-like environment. These facilities can range in size from one resident to several hundred and may offer a wide variety of personal and nursing services designed specifically to meet an individual's personal needs.Facilities are licensed to provide routine personal care services under a "Standard" license, or more specific services under the authority of "Specialty" licenses. ALFs meeting the requirements for a Standard license may also qualify for specialty licenses. The purpose of "Specialty Licenses" is to allow individuals to "age in place" in familiar surroundings that can adequately and safely meet their continuing healthcare needs.Notices/UpdatesRenew Online – Providers can now renew their licenses through the Agency’s Online Licensing application.
