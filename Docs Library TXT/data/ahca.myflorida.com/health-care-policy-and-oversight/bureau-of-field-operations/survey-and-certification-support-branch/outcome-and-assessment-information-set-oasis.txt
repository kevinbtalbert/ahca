Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)











Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)Florida home health agencies that are Medicare-certified or Medicaid-enrolled are required to electronically transmit to the state database in accordance with the federal reporting regulation (effective July 19, 1999). Florida HHAs should be using CMS-issued branch identifiers in M0016 instead of the prior Florida requirement to enter the state license number (without the preceding 'HHA' designation).The OASIS Helpdesk has an e-mail alert system to notify registered providers or interested parties of "late-breaking" OASIS information. Complete as much information using the registration link and check OASIS for Provider Type and Opt-In to receive emails or Opt-Out if you wish to stop receiving emails.Sign Up for OASIS AlertsOASIS questions can be emailed to the Agency for Health Care Administration (Florida QIES Helpdesk) at:FLQIES_HELP@ahca.myflorida.comForms:
