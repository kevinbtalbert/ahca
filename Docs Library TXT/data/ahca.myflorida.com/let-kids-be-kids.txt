 and found that several services for the treatment of gender dysphoria – i.e., sex reassignment surgery, cross-sex hormones, and puberty blockers – are not consistent with widely accepted professional medical standards and are experimental and investigational with the potential for harmful long term affects.What You Should KnowThe Agency’s report summarizes the scientific research about the effectiveness of treatment for gender dysphoria for children. Research found:Scientific studies supporting hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers, and sex reassignment surgery for treating gender dysphoria  are weak to very weak.The evidence showing benefits from hormone replacement therapies for gender dysphoria is  very weak.Scientific studies  do not show  that the use of puberty blockers improves mental health.There is  a lack of  long term, follow-up studies after sex reassignment surgery.There are  no randomized control trials  on the effectiveness of “gender affirming" treatment.In clinical research, randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of a new treatment.
